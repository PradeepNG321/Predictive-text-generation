Crash Boom Bang ! ' s stages resemble board games , as each play area is split into a number of squares . The game takes place among four players , with the computer assigned to spare players . All players simultaneously roll dice . The number each player rolls is the amount of squares they move forward . Depending on the type of square that the player lands on , Wumpa Fruit which is used as points during the race can be won or lost , an item can be obtained , a special event might be triggered , or a mini - game might commence . If a player lands on a fork in the road , the player will have to select the desired direction with either the stylus or the control pad .

Goffman 's book , Forms of Talk 1981 , includes five essays : Replies and Responses 1976 ; Response Cries 1978 ; Footing 1979 ; The Lecture 1976 ; and Radio Talk 1981 . Each essay addresses both verbal and non - verbal communication through a sociolinguistic model . The book provides a comprehensive overview of the study of talk . In the introduction , Goffman identifies three themes that recur throughout the text : ritualization , participation framework , and embedding .
The first modern computers were the massive code breaking machines of the Second World War such as Z3 , ENIAC and Colossus . The latter two of these machines were based on the theoretical foundation laid by Alan Turing and developed by John von Neumann .
When King James I and VI of Scotland died in March 1625 , his successor King Charles I maintained Calvert 's barony but not his previous place on the Privy Council . Calvert then turned his attention to his Irish estates and his overseas investments . He was not entirely forgotten at court . After Buckingham 's dabblings in wars against Spain and France had ended in failure , he recalled Baltimore to court , and for a while may have considered employing him in the peace negotiations with Spain . Though nothing came of Baltimore 's recall , he renewed his rights over the silk - import duties , which had lapsed with the death of James I , and secured Charles ' blessing for his venture in the New Found Land .
Late in the afternoon of 13 January 1798 , Sybille and Fox arrived in Manila Bay , slipping unchallenged past the fortress of Corregidor and then sailing across the bay on the morning of 14 January , anchoring between Manila and Cavite . From his vantage point Cooke could see the Spanish squadron dismasted and under repair in Cavite , the ships of the line San Pedro , Europa and Monta s and the frigates Maria de la Cabeya and Luisa in dock and unfit for action . To Cooke 's disappointment he could also see the Manila galleon , Marquesetta being unloaded at the Cavite docks and another valuable merchant ship Rey Carlos aground in the harbour . The Spanish had learned only shortly before Cooke 's arrival that the British frigate HMS Resistance under Captain Edward Pakenham was in Philippine waters and had decided to remove the valuable cargo from the treasure ship rather than risk an attack .
Cave paintings from more than 3 , 500 years ago document burns and their management . The earliest Egyptian records on treating burns describes dressings prepared with milk from mothers of baby boys , and the 1500 BCE Edwin Smith Papyrus describes treatments using honey and the salve of resin . Many other treatments have been used over the ages , including the use of tea leaves by the Chinese documented to 600 BCE , pig fat and vinegar by Hippocrates documented to 400 BCE , and wine and myrrh by Celsus documented to 100 CE . French barber - surgeon Ambroise Par was the first to describe different degrees of burns in the 1500s . Guillaume Dupuytren expanded these degrees into six different severities in 1832 .
The Rugby Football Union RFU had created the national side 's emblem prior to an English team being sent to Edinburgh to play a Scottish side . A red rose was chosen to be the side 's emblem . The white kit worn by the national team was taken from the kit used at Rugby School . Alfred Wright , an employee of the Rugby Football Union , is credited with the standardisation and new design of the rose , which up until 1920 had undergone many variations in its depiction . The Wright design is thought to have been used without minor alteration until the late 1990s . It was not until 1997 that the rose was modernised when Nike became the official strip supplier .
Filming of Series One was completed in December 1965 . A second series was also commissioned late that year and entered production in March 1966 . Barwick became a full - time member of the writing staff and took over the role of script editor from the outgoing Pattillo . The main puppet cast and vehicles were rebuilt ; in addition , the art department expanded some of the standing sets , including the Tracy Villa lounge and the Thunderbird 5 control room . To accommodate the simultaneous filming of the TV series and Thunderbirds Are Go , APF purchased two more buildings on the Slough Trading Estate and converted them into new stages . As crew and studio space were divided between the two productions , filming of the TV series progressed at half the previous speed , as APF 's B crew produced one episode per month . Filming on Thunderbirds Are Go was completed by June , allowing A crew to resume work on the series to shoot what would prove to be its penultimate episode , Ricochet .
The portion of current Route 50 between Seaville and Petersburg received funding in 1910 to become a spur of the Ocean Highway . In 1917 , what is now Route 50 was designated a part of pre - 1927 Route 14 , a route that was to run from Cape May to Egg Harbor City . Route 50 was designated onto its current alignment in 1927 , replacing this portion of pre - 1927 Route 14 . In 1960 , a freeway was proposed for Route 50 , running from the Garden State Parkway in Dennis Township to US 30 in Mullica Township . This proposal was canceled by the mid - 1970s due to financial and environmental concerns as well as lack of traffic . The interchange between Route 50 and the Atlantic City Expressway was reconstructed into a full interchange , with completion in June 2010 .
At this stage of the battle fighting paused . Mortier and Gazan waited for Dupont 's arrival while Kutuzov and Miloradovich waited for Strik 's and Dokhturov 's . Schmitt 's column was expected to be the last to join the fight because it had to march the greatest distance . The timing of the respite varies , depending on whose reports are consulted : fighting paused at around 12 : 00 or 14 : 00 . Strik arrived first and immediately assaulted Gazan 's line with three battalions , pushing the French out of D renstein . Caught between two strong forces , Gazan attempted to push his way back through D renstein , to reach the river where the flotilla could evacuate his exhausted troops . Withdrawing through the narrow Danube canyon and fighting off the Russian force at their rear , Gazan and his division were trapped when more of Strik 's Russians appeared to block their retreat . The narrow defiles hampered the Russians ; Strik 's men had to march out of the canyons , form ranks and attack in waves . Despite Strik 's continuous assault in the next two to three hours , Mortier and Gazan pushed the Russians back up the narrow fissure in the hillside . At this point , Dokhturov 's column appeared behind the French line and joined the battle . The French were outnumbered more than three to one , assaulted in the front by Miloradovich 's column , in the middle by Strik 's and in the rear by Dokhturov .

The Australian mainland came under attack during 1942 and 1943 . Japanese submarines operated off Australia from May to August 1942 and January to June 1943 . These attacks sought to cut the Allied supply lines between Australia and the US and Australia and New Guinea , but were unsuccessful . Japanese aircraft also conducted air raids against Allied bases in northern Australia which were being used to mount the North Western Area Campaign against Japanese positions in the Netherlands East Indies NEI .
In addition to the storms which attained at least tropical storm strength in 1940 , five additional tropical depressions were analyzed by the HURDAT reanalysis project to have developed during the season . Due to their weak intensity , however , they were not added to HURDAT . On September 2 , a closed low - pressure area was detected in the open Atlantic Ocean southeast of Bermuda and was analyzed as a tropical depression . At the time , the disturbance had a minimum pressure of at least 1015 mbar hPa ; 29 . 98 inHg . The depression initially moved to the southeast , but later recurved towards the northwest over the next two days . On September 4 , the S.S. West Kebar en route for Boston , Massachusetts reported winds of 40 mph 65 km h , which would be considered as tropical storm - force winds . The depression later moved to the northeast before it was absorbed by a stationary front on September 7 . Since there was only one report that the disturbance may have reached tropical storm intensity , it was not included in HURDAT . Later on September 10 , a trough was detected in a similar region in the Atlantic where the first depression formed . The trough later became sufficiently organized to be classified as a tropical depression . The cyclone moved slowly to the east and did not further intensify before dissipating on September 13 .
Intertoto Cup 2 :
They lost 4 men in this action . The fifth team also succeeded in completing all their objectives but almost half its men were killed . The other two Commando groups were not as successful . The MLs transporting Groups One and Two had almost all been destroyed on their approach . ML 457 was the only boat to land its Commandos on the Old Mole and only ML 177 had managed to reach the gates at the old entrance to the basin . That team succeeded in planting charges on two tugboats moored in the basin .
Machinery problems were likely to delay the ships well past their intended delivery dates of 1943 44 . Three turbines were delivered by Brown Boveri in 1939 to Arkhangelsk for the Sovetskaya Rossiya , but the Kharkhovskii Turbogenerator Works never completed a single turbine before the German invasion in June 1941 . A prototype boiler was supposed to have been built ashore for evaluation , but it was not completed until early 1941 , which further complicated the production plan .

Like other stingrays , the diamond stingray is aplacental viviparous : the embryos are initially nourished by yolk , and later by histotroph uterine milk , rich in proteins and lipids produced by the mother . Only the left ovary and uterus are functional in adult females . Several bays along the Pacific coast of Baja California are known to serve as nurseries . Most of the life history information available on this species has come from Bah a Magdalena , where females bear one litter of 1 4 pups per year . Courtship and mating occurs in late summer from July to August , but due to a ten - month period of either sperm storage or diapause wherein the embryo becomes dormant , embryonic development does not begin until the following year and is completed within 2 3 months . Birthing takes place in summer from July to September in shallow estuaries ; the newborns measure 18 23 cm 7 . 1 9 . 1 in across . During El Ni o years , the higher temperatures appear to shift the timing of birth forward . The diamond stingray has the lowest growth rate of any stingray species yet studied . Males reach sexual maturity at around 43 47 cm 17 19 in across and 7 years of age , while females grow slower still , reaching maturity at around 57 66 cm 22 26 in across and 10 years of age . The maximum lifespan has been estimated at least 19 years for males and 28 years for females .

Croatia was first recognized as an independent state on 26 June 1991 by Slovenia , which declared its own independence on the same day as Croatia . Lithuania followed on 30 July , and Ukraine , Latvia , Iceland , and Germany in December 1991 . The EEC countries granted Croatia recognition on 15 January 1992 , and the United Nations admitted them in May 1992 .
The 1940 Atlantic hurricane season was a generally average period of tropical cyclogenesis in 1940 . Though the season had no official bounds , most tropical cyclone activity occurred during August and September . Throughout the year , fourteen tropical cyclones formed , of which nine reached tropical storm intensity ; six were hurricanes . None of the hurricanes reached major hurricane intensity . Tropical cyclones that did not approach populated areas or shipping lanes , especially if they were relatively weak and of short duration , may have remained undetected . Because technologies such as satellite monitoring were not available until the 1960s , historical data on tropical cyclones from this period are often not reliable . As a result of a reanalysis project which analyzed the season in 2012 , an additional hurricane was added to HURDAT . The year 's first tropical storm formed on May 19 off the northern coast of Hispaniola . At the time , this was a rare occurrence , as only four other tropical disturbances were known to have formed prior during this period ; since then , reanalysis of previous seasons has concluded that there were more than four tropical cyclones in May before 1940 . The season 's final system was a tropical disturbance situated in the Greater Antilles , which dissipated on November 8 .
The Regional Somali Language Academy is an intergovernmental regulating body for the Somali language in the Horn region . In January 2015 , President of Somalia Hassan Sheikh Mohamud announced that the institute was slated to be finalized in conjunction with the governments of Djibouti and Ethiopia . Among the scheduled projects was the construction of a new headquarters for the Academy in Mogadishu , in recognition of Somalia 's traditional position as the center for the development and promotion of the Somali language . In February 2015 , the foundation stone for the new Regional Somali Language Academy was officially laid at an inauguration ceremony in the city .
The following year , Pound and Flint fell out over their different interpretations of the history and goals of the group arising from an article on the history of Imagism written by Flint and published in The Egoist in May 1915 . Flint was at pains to emphasise the contribution of the Eiffel Tower poets , especially Edward Storer . Pound , who believed that the Hellenic hardness that he saw as the distinguishing quality of the poems of H.D. and Aldington was likely to be diluted by the custard of Storer , was to play no further direct role in the history of the Imagists . He went on to co - found the Vorticists with his friend , the painter and writer Wyndham Lewis .
New gods continued to emerge after this transformation . Some important deities like Isis and Amun are not known to have appeared until the Old Kingdom c . 2686 2181 BC . Places and concepts could suddenly inspire the creation of a deity to represent them , and deities were sometimes created to serve as opposite - sex counterparts to established gods or goddesses . Kings were said to be divine , although only a few continued to be worshipped long after their deaths . Some non - royal humans were said to have the favor of the gods and were venerated accordingly . This veneration was usually short - lived , but the court architects Imhotep and Amenhotep son of Hapu were regarded as gods centuries after their lifetimes , as were some other officials .
Broward asked James O. Wright an engineer on loan to the State of Florida from the USDA 's Bureau of Drainage Investigations to draw up plans for drainage in 1906 . Two dredges were built by 1908 , but had cut only 6 miles 9 . 7 km of canals . The project quickly ran out of money , so Broward sold real estate developer Richard J. Bolles a million dollars worth of land in the Everglades , 500 , 000 acres 2 , 000 km2 , before the engineer 's report had been submitted . Abstracts from Wright 's report were given to the IIF stating that eight canals would be enough to drain 1 , 850 , 000 acres 7 , 500 km2 at a cost of a dollar an acre . The abstracts were released to real estate developers who used them in their advertisements , and Wright and the USDA were pressed by the real estate industry to publicize the report as quickly as possible . Wright 's supervisor noted errors in the report , as well as undue enthusiasm for draining , and delayed its release in 1910 . Different unofficial versions of the report circulated some that had been altered by real estate interests and a version hastily put together by Senator Duncan U. Fletcher called U.S. Senate Document 89 included early unrevised statements , causing a frenzy of speculation .
Embedded in Japanese folklore as they are , kitsune appear in numerous Japanese works . Noh , kyogen , bunraku , and kabuki plays derived from folk tales feature them , as do contemporary works such as anime , manga and video games . Japanese metal idol band Babymetal refer to the kitsune myth in their lyrics and include the use of fox masks , hand signs , and animation interludes during live shows . Western authors of fiction have also made use of the kitsune legends .
 Joyful , Joyful is a song by contemporary Christian music band Casting Crowns from their fourth studio album Until the Whole World Hears 2009 . Written by Mark Hall and Bernie Herms and produced by Mark A. Miller , the song is a re - interpretation of the hymn Joyful , Joyful We Adore Thee and Ludwig van Beethoven 's Symphony No. 9 . Joyful , Joyful , a CCM and alternative CCM song , is driven by a string section that has been compared to Coldplay 's song Viva la Vida . It received positive reviews from music critics and received airplay over the 2010 Christmas season , peaking at number three on the Billboard Hot Christian Songs chart .

Inocybe praetervisa leaves a clay - brown spore print , while the spores themselves are rectangular with a large number of distinct , angular knobs . In size , the spores measure between 10 and 12 micrometres 0 . 00039 and 0 . 00047 in in length by between 7 and 9 micrometres 0 . 00028 and 0 . 00035 in in width . Inocybe praetervisa has both pleuro- and cheilocystidia which are relatively spindle - shaped with apical encrustation . The cystidia have hyaline or pale yellow walls .
In 1951 , a small airstrip was built at the ruins , which previously could only be reached by several days ' travel through the jungle on foot or mule . In 1956 the Tikal project began to map the city on a scale not previously seen in the Maya area . From 1956 through 1970 , major archaeological excavations were carried out by the University of Pennsylvania Tikal Project . They mapped much of the site and excavated and restored many of the structures . Excavations directed by Edwin M. Shook and later by William Coe of the university investigated the North Acropolis and the Central Plaza from 1957 to 1969 . The Tikal Project recorded over 200 monuments at the site . In 1979 , the Guatemalan government began a further archeological project at Tikal , which continued through to 1984 .
Alice in Chains rose to international fame as part of the grunge movement of the early 1990s , along with other Seattle bands such as Nirvana , Pearl Jam , and Soundgarden . The band was one of the most successful music acts of the 1990s , selling over 20 million albums worldwide , and over 14 million in the US alone . In 1992 the band 's second album , Dirt , was released to critical acclaim and was certified quadruple platinum . Their third album , Alice in Chains , was released in 1995 and has been certified double platinum . It achieved No. 1 position on the Billboard 200 chart . The band has had 14 top ten songs on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and nine Grammy Award nominations .
The final blame for the military stalemate was determined to lie not in military preparation , supplies , leadership , or superior tactics by the Seminoles , but in Florida 's impenetrable terrain . An army surgeon wrote : It is in fact a most hideous region to live in , a perfect paradise for Indians , alligators , serpents , frogs , and every other kind of loathsome reptile . The land seemed to inspire extreme reactions of wonder or hatred . In 1870 , an author described the mangrove forests as a waste of nature 's grandest exhibition to have these carnivals of splendid vegetation occurring in isolated places where it is but seldom they are seen . A band of hunters , naturalists , and collectors ventured through in 1885 , taking along with them the 17 - year - old grandson of an early resident of Miami . The landscape unnerved the young man shortly after he entered the Shark River : The place looked wild and lonely . About three o 'clock it seemed to get on Henry 's nerves and we saw him crying , he would not tell us why , he was just plain scared . 
Previously a widely played sport in the city , Manila is now the home of the only sizable baseball stadium in the country , at the Rizal Memorial Baseball Stadium . The stadium hosts games of Baseball Philippines ; Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth were the first players to score a home run at the stadium at their tour of the country on December 2 , 1934 .

Attempts were made to fix the problems and were at least partially successful in stopping many of the leaks . The ship was commissioned on 22 November and became the flagship of Flag Officer Josiah Tattnall , commander of the naval defenses of Georgia . Under pressure from Mallory to engage the blockading ships , Tattnall attempted to engage them before any ironclads arrived on 5 January 1863 , but army engineers could not clear the obstacles blocking the channel in a timely manner , despite early coordination being made by Tattnall to do so . It took another month to actually clear the obstacles and two monitors arrived before the end of January . Nonetheless Tattnall attempted to pass through the obstructions during high tide on 3 February , but high winds prevented the water from rising enough to allow the ship to do so . After Atlanta successfully passed through them on 19 March , Tattnall planned to attack the Union base at Port Royal , South Carolina while the monitors were attacking Charleston . Deserters revealed Tatnall 's plan while he was waiting at the head of Wassaw Sound and he was forced to retreat when three monitors augmented the defenses at Port Royal . Dissatisfied with Tattnall 's perceived lack of aggressiveness , Mallory replaced Tattnall as commander of the Savannah squadron later that month with Commander Richard L. Page . Page , in his turn was relieved in May by Commander William A. Webb ; Atlanta remained the squadron flagship throughout this time .
The closure problem takes as input a directed acyclic graph with weights on its vertices and seeks the minimum or maximum weight of a closure , a set of vertices with no outgoing edges . The problem may be formulated for directed graphs without the assumption of acyclicity , but with no greater generality , because in this case it is equivalent to the same problem on the condensation of the graph . It may be solved in polynomial time using a reduction to the maximum flow problem .
The site later fell into oblivion until the XIX century
The M - 240 Storm MultiMission Vehicle is the first of three Storm generations . A variant of the 1991 Jeep Wrangler YJ and the older CJ - 6 CJ - 8 wheelbase , it is entirely produced in Israel by Automotive Industries Ltd. with the exception of the engines , as their manufacture is not economically viable on the Storm 's market scale .
The tower had two floors and a mezzanine . On the first floor was the famous Sundial Room or Meridian Room , which was initially an open loggia . Pope Urban VIII had it enclosed and it was subsequently decorated with long sequences of frescoes painted between 1580 and 1582 by Simon Lagi and the two Flemish artists Paul and Matthijs Bril . Today the tower has paintings by Cristoforo Roncalli and Matteino da Siena .
Maryland Route 194 MD 194 is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland . The state highway runs 23 . 87 miles 38 . 42 km from MD 26 in Ceresville north to the Pennsylvania state line near Taneytown , where the highway continues as Pennsylvania Route 194 PA 194 toward Hanover . MD 194 is the main highway between Frederick and Hanover ; the state highway connects the towns of Walkersville and Woodsboro in northeastern Frederick County with Keymar and Taneytown in northwestern Carroll County . MD 194 was blazed as a migration route in the 18th century and a pair of turnpikes in Frederick County in the 19th century , one of which was the last private toll road in Maryland . The state highway , which was originally designated MD 71 , was built as a modern highway in Frederick County in the mid - 1920s and constructed as Francis Scott Key Highway in Carroll County in the late 1920s and early 1930s . MD 194 received its modern route number in 1956 as part of a three - route number swap . The state highway 's bypasses of Walkersville and Woodsboro opened in the early 1980s and mid - 1990s , respectively .
Some of the original stories were well - received : for example , Ray Bradbury 's The Impossible , which appeared in the November 1949 issue , and was later included in Bradbury 's book The Martian Chronicles , is described by sf historian Raymond Thompson as a haunting ... comment on man 's attempts to realize his conflicting hopes and dreams . Thompson also comments positively on Poul Anderson 's early story Terminal Quest , in Super Science Stories 's final issue , dated August 1951 ; and on Arthur C. Clarke 's Exile of the Eons in the March 1950 issue . John D. MacDonald also contributed good material .
Despite the general reputation as a mass producer and a consensus that the region is in the midst of an economic crisis , parts of the Languedoc wine industry are experiencing commercial success due to outside investment and an increased focus on quality . Sales have been improved by many vineyards that concentrate on creating a good brand name rather than relying on the sometimes infamous regional designations . Some vineyards have adopted the youngest batch of AOC classifications developed in the late 1990s , while other vineyards eschew designated blends entirely and are instead shifting toward bottling single varietal wines , a practice increasingly demanded by consumers in the large New World wine market .
Below is a comparison of the Regional GDP on the island of Ireland .
Despite the two jurisdictions using two distinct currencies the euro and pound sterling , a growing amount of commercial activity is carried out on an all - Ireland basis . This has been facilitated by the two jurisdictions ' shared membership of the European Union , and there have been calls from members of the business community and policymakers for the creation of an all - Ireland economy to take advantage of economies of scale and boost competitiveness .
Several critics have focused on the theme of motherhood . In Mothers and Daughters Aging and Dying , Claire Sprague wrote that Lessing often dwells on the theme of mothers passing their behaviours onto their daughters , and how the cycle of daughters fighting their mothers permeates each generation . The British novelist Jane Rogers said that The Good Terrorist is as unsparing and incisive about motherhood as it is about the extreme left . She stated that motherhood here is terrible : Alice 's mother is reduced to despair continually yielding to her selfish daughter 's demands ; Alice mothers Jasper , and has a similar despairing relationship with him . Rogers added that motherhood is depicted here as a compulsion to protect the weak , despite their propensity to retaliate and hurt you .
As the case wore on , Warren reflected that the bottom had fallen out of our world We lost our trust for each other . Her brother , Jay Warren , who was accused of indecent assault , was the only defendant among the seven accused to be acquitted on 24 October 2004 .

In spite or perhaps because of his role in these nuclear tests , Reines was concerned about the dangers of radioactive pollution from atmospheric nuclear tests , and became an advocate of underground nuclear testing . In the wake of the Sputnik crisis , he participated in John Archibald Wheeler 's Project 137 , which evolved into JASON . He was also a delegate at the Atoms for Peace Conference in Geneva in 1958 .
When studies indicated the proposed jetport would create 4 , 000 , 000 US gallons 15 , 000 , 000 L of raw sewage a day and 10 , 000 short tons 9 , 100 t of jet engine pollutants a year , the national media snapped to attention . Science magazine wrote , in a series on environmental protection highlighting the jetport project , Environmental scientists have become increasingly aware that , without careful planning , development of a region and the conservation of its natural resources do not go hand in hand . The New York Times called it a blueprint for disaster , and Wisconsin senator Gaylord Nelson wrote to President Richard Nixon voicing his opposition : It is a test of whether or not we are really committed in this country to protecting our environment . Governor Claude Kirk withdrew his support for the project , and the 78 - year - old Marjory Stoneman Douglas was persuaded to go on tour to give hundreds of speeches against it . She established Friends of the Everglades and encouraged more than 3 , 000 members to join . Initially the U.S. Department of Transportation pledged funds to support the jetport , but after pressure , Nixon overruled the department . He instead established Big Cypress National Preserve , announcing it in the Special Message to the Congress Outlining the 1972 Environmental Program . Following the jetport proposition , restoration of the Everglades became not only a statewide priority , but an international one as well . In the 1970s the Everglades were declared an International Biosphere Reserve and a World Heritage Site by UNESCO , and a Wetland of International Importance by the Ramsar Convention , making it one of only three locations on earth that have appeared on all three lists .
Of Human Feelings received considerable acclaim from contemporary critics . In a review for Esquire , Gary Giddins hailed it as another landmark album from Coleman and his most accomplished work of harmolodics , partly because of compositions which he found clearly expressed and occasionally timeless . In his opinion , the discordant keys radically transmuted conventional polyphony and would be the most challenging part for listeners , whom he said should concentrate on Coleman 's playing and let the maelstrom resolve itself around his center . Kofi Natambu from the Detroit Metro Times said Coleman 's synergetic approach displayed expressive immediacy rather than superficial technical flair while calling the record a multi - tonal mosaic of great power , humor , color , wit , sensuality , compassion and tenderness . He found the songs inspirational , danceable , and encompassing developments in African - American music over the previous century . Robert Christgau found the music heartfelt and sophisticated in its exchange of rhythms and simple pieces of melody , writing in The Village Voice , the way the players break into ripples of song only to ebb back into the tideway is participatory democracy at its most practical and utopian . 
In the main event , Bret Hart retained his WWF World Heavyweight Championship against Shawn Michaels . The card also included a highly - promoted match in which the team of Randy Savage and Mr. Perfect defeated the team of Ric Flair and Razor Ramon by disqualification ; The Ultimate Warrior was advertised for the show but left the company and was replaced by Perfect . Also featured were two speciality matches : The Undertaker won a coffin match against Kamala , and The Big Boss Man defeated Nailz in a nightstick on a pole match .

In Part II of the series , Shikamaru is assigned the task of locating two members of the criminal organization Akatsuki . While his team manages to find their targets , the immortal Akatsuki member Hidan kills Asuma Sarutobi during the course of the battle despite Shikamaru 's best efforts . After Asuma 's funeral , Shikamaru sets out with the surviving members of Team 10 to avenge their mentor with the aid of Kakashi Hatake . As the other deal with Hidan 's partner Kakuzu , Shikamaru avenges Asuma by defeating Hidan and making sure the Akatsuki member 's body is never found . Following the fight , Shikamaru vows to protect Kurenai Yuhi and Asuma 's newborn daughter . He is later assigned to the Fourth Division alongside Temari and Ch ji . He is named a proxy general under Gaara . In the series epilogue , stating his personal desire during the series of final battles , Shikamaru becomes advisor to the Seventh Hokage Naruto after marrying Temari and gaining a son in Shikadai Nara .
The producers cast relatively unknown British actors for the series . Scottish actress Lindsay Duncan , who was cast as Servilia , believed that she and other UK actors can do old , can do classic , and you believe it . She also said that because of long distances , American actors or those of other nationalities were avoided : Transporting actors from Los Angeles to Rome on a regular basis does not look good for the budget . We 're quite cheap . Stamp described Servilia as the great love of Julius Caesar 's life , his mistress and by all counts the only woman he truly loved . Irish actor Ciar n Hinds was cast as Caesar . Hinds first thought it was silly to be offered the part , but then you think it 's quite an honour to be chosen to play it . And then you think , ' Oh shit I 've got to do it ' , and then , well , ' I suppose someone has to do it ! ' Heller had believed that Hinds would make a great Caesar for a long time , and considered the series extremely lucky for being able to cast him .
In the 2005 civic election , he was again elected , though his Richmond First party only won three of the eight seats . He unsuccessfully lobbied his fellow councillors to appoint him to fill one of Richmond 's two seats at Metro Vancouver . With not even his own party members supporting him for the Metro Vancouver seat and finding himself being alone in a number of issues , such as supporting the SkyTrain line being elevated , opposing the tree preservation bylaw , and wanting to hire more police officers , Howard left the Richmond First party in February 2006 to be an independent .
General Lee responded to the British landing with several actions . He began reinforcing positions on the mainland in case the British were intending to launch an attack directly on Charleston . He also attempted to build a bridge of boats to provide an avenue of retreat for the fort 's garrison , but this failed because there were not enough boats to bridge the roughly one mile 1 . 6 km channel separating the island from Charleston ; the unwillingness of Moultrie and Rutledge to support the effort may also have played a role . The Americans also constructed an entrenchment at the northern end of Sullivan 's Island , which was manned by more than 750 men and three small cannons , and began to fortify a guard post at Haddrell 's Point on the mainland opposite Fort Sullivan .
The radiation zone is the region of the stellar interior where the flux of energy outward is dependent on radiative heat transfer , since convective heat transfer is inefficient in that zone . In this region the plasma will not be perturbed , and any mass motions will die out . If this is not the case , however , then the plasma becomes unstable and convection will occur , forming a convection zone . This can occur , for example , in regions where very high energy fluxes occur , such as near the core or in areas with high opacity making radiatative heat transfer inefficient as in the outer envelope .
The ships had a median displacement of 1 , 050 long tons 1 , 070 t , were just over 305 feet 93 m in length , and had a beam of about 31 feet 9 . 4 m . All of the ships had two direct - drive steam turbines and a combination of other engines for cruising at speeds less than 15 knots 28 km h . All of the ships were designed for a maximum speed of 29 knots 54 km h . As built , they were armed with four 4 - inch 102 mm guns and had four twin 21 - inch torpedo tubes with a load of eight torpedoes , but all were later equipped with depth charges . The ships were built by four private American shipyards Bath Iron Works , Fore River Shipbuilding Company , New York Shipbuilding Corporation , and William Cramp and Sons and were laid down between September and November 1913 ; launched between April 1914 and February 1915 ; and commissioned into the U.S. Navy between June 1914 and August 1915 .
Despite not making landfall on the United States , the hurricane caused widespread damage . Extensive precautionary measures were undertaken across the coast , particularly in New England . The heightened precautions were due in part to fears that effects from the storm would be similar to that of a devastating hurricane which struck the region two years prior . Most of the damage associated with the hurricane occurred in New Jersey , where the combination of moisture from the hurricane and a stationary front produced record rainfall , peaking at 24 in 610 mm in the town of Ewan . This would make the storm the wettest in state history . The resultant floods damaged infrastructure , mostly to road networks . Damage in the state amounted to 4 million . Further north in New England , strong winds were reported , though damage remained minimal . Although the storm made two landfalls in Atlantic Canada , damage too was minimal , and was limited to several boating incidents caused by strong waves . Overall , the hurricane caused 4 . 05 million in damage , primarily due to flooding in New Jersey , and seven fatalities .
The National Library of Somalia was established in 1975 , and came under the responsibility of the Ministry of Education , Culture and Higher Education . In 1983 , it held approximately 7 , 000 books , little in the way of historical and cultural archival material , and was open to the general public . The National Library later closed down in the 1990s . In June 2013 , the Heritage Institute for Policy Studies organized a shipment of 22 , 000 books from the United States to Somalia as part of an initiative to restock the library . In December of the year , the Somali authorities officially launched a major project to rebuild the National Library . With Zainab Hassan serving as Director , the 1 million federal government funded initiative will see a new library complex built in the capital within six months . In preparation for the relaunch , 60 , 000 additional books from other Arab League states are expected to arrive .
Jinks and Cohen involved Ball throughout the film 's development , including casting and director selection . The producers met with about 20 interested directors , several of whom were considered A - list at the time . Ball was not keen on the more well - known directors because he believed their involvement would increase the budget and lead DreamWorks to become nervous about the content . Nevertheless , the studio offered the film to Mike Nichols and Robert Zemeckis ; neither accepted . In the same year , Mendes then a theater director revived the musical Cabaret in New York with fellow director Rob Marshall . Beth Swofford of the Creative Artists Agency arranged meetings for Mendes with studio figures in Los Angeles to see if film direction was a possibility . Mendes came across American Beauty in a pile of eight scripts at Swofford 's house , and knew immediately that it was the one he wanted to make ; early in his career , he had been inspired by how the film Paris , Texas 1984 presented contemporary America as a mythic landscape and he saw the same theme in American Beauty , as well as parallels with his own childhood . Mendes later met with Spielberg ; impressed by Mendes ' productions of Oliver ! and Cabaret , Spielberg encouraged him to consider American Beauty .
Scheduling the concert meant a financial loss of 500 , 000 for the band , despite sponsorship from Coca - Cola and GSM . Ticket prices were set at just DM 8 8 , US 18 , because of the 50 percent unemployment rate in the city . Bono offered for the group to perform a benefit concert or small show in Sarajevo , but the city requested they hold the full PopMart show . Bono said , We offered to do a charity gig here , just turn up and do a scratch gig , but they wanted the whole fucking thing . They wanted the lemon ! McGuinness added , we felt it was important that we treat this as another city on the tour , to pay them that respect . To come here and not do the whole show would have been rude . According to news releases following the concert , the total net income for the show was US 13 , 500 ; however , tour promoter John Giddings noted that price did not include the costs of the production or transportation .
Continuous , short - arc , high pressure xenon arc lamps have a color temperature closely approximating noon sunlight and are used in solar simulators . That is , the chromaticity of these lamps closely approximates a heated black body radiator that has a temperature close to that observed from the Sun . After they were first introduced during the 1940s , these lamps began replacing the shorter - lived carbon arc lamps in movie projectors . They are employed in typical 35mm , IMAX and the new digital projectors film projection systems , automotive HID headlights , high - end tactical flashlights and other specialized uses . These arc lamps are an excellent source of short wavelength ultraviolet radiation and they have intense emissions in the near infrared , which is used in some night vision systems .
Schumann 's attack on Les Huguenots was clearly a personal diatribe against Meyerbeer 's Judaism : ' Time and time again we had to turn away in disgust ... One may search in vain for a sustained pure thought , a truly Christian sentiment ... It is all contrived , all make believe and hypocrisy ! ... The shrewdest of composers rubs his hands with glee.'
 Don 't You Wanna Stay is a country pop song with a length of four minutes and sixteen seconds . It incorporates melancholic guitar riff which is accompanied by classical elements such as violin . John Hill of About.com considered the song as a classic power ballad , writing whether you want to call the song country , pop , or something in between doesn 't matter because the chorus is so catchy that it doesn 't matter if you use an electric guitar or a steel guitar . It is set in common time and has a steady tempo of 72 beats per minute . It is written in the key of G - sharp minor and both Aldean and Clarkson 's vocals span two octaves , from A 3 to G 5 . It follows the chord progression G m E B. Bob Peacock of Roughstock thought that the structure of the song was interesting with its brief four - line verses and don 't you wanna stay 's throughout the chorus . As the chorus of the song starts in , the sound of electric and slide guitars are prominent as Aldean and Clarkson sing , Don 't you wanna hold each other tight Don 't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight ? 
Paul Newman reprised his role as Fast Eddie Felson in the 1986 film The Color of Money , for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role . A number of observers and critics have suggested that this Oscar was in belated recognition for his performance in The Hustler . In 1997 , the Library of Congress selected The Hustler for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant . Carroll and Rossen 's screenplay was selected by the Writers Guild of America in 2006 as the 96th best motion picture screenplay of all time . In June 2008 , AFI released its Ten top Ten the best ten films in ten classic American film genres after polling over 1 , 500 people from the creative community . The Hustler was acknowledged as the sixth best film in the sports genre .

The diagnosis and classification of AML can be challenging , and should be performed by a qualified hematopathologist or hematologist . In straightforward cases , the presence of certain morphologic features such as Auer rods or specific flow cytometry results can distinguish AML from other leukemias ; however , in the absence of such features , diagnosis may be more difficult .
Another relationship Nicole pursued was with Aden Jefferies , her longtime closest friend . Aden had a strong fanbase from his previous relationship with Belle Taylor .

She also had an affair with an older male character , Sid Walker . James liked the fact Nicole had so many romances because she got to kiss many of her co - stars .
Soon after Henry 's coronation Gerard was appointed to the recently vacant see of York , and became embroiled in the long - running dispute between York and the see of Canterbury concerning which archbishopric had primacy over England . Gerard managed to secure papal recognition of York 's claim to jurisdiction over the church in Scotland , but he was forced to agree to a compromise with his counterpart at Canterbury , Anselm , over Canterbury 's claims to authority over York , although it was not binding on his successors . In the Investiture Controversy between the king and the papacy over the right to appoint bishops , Gerard worked on reconciling the claims of the two parties ; the controversy was finally resolved in 1107 .

Most of the remaining areas of what is now the state were purchased in 1803 from France as part of the Louisiana Purchase the area west of the Mississippi having been recently acquired by France from Spain . Parts of northern Minnesota were considered to be in Rupert 's Land , a large territory owned by Hudson 's Bay Company . The exact definition of the boundary between Minnesota and British North America was not addressed until the Anglo - American Convention of 1818 .
Following repairs in July 1916 , Markgraf went into the Baltic for trials . The ship was then temporarily assigned to the I Scouting Group for the fleet operation on 18 19 August . Due to the serious damage incurred by Seydlitz and Derfflinger at Jutland , the only battlecruisers available for the operation were Von der Tann and Moltke , which were joined by Markgraf , Grosser Kurf rst , and the new battleship Bayern . The British were aware of the German plans , and sortied the Grand Fleet to meet them . By 14 : 35 , Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet 's approach and , unwilling to engage the whole of the Grand Fleet just 11 weeks after the decidedly close engagement at Jutland , turned his forces around and retreated to German ports .

After the United Kingdom 's entry into World War I in 1914 , Wheeler volunteered for the armed forces . Although preferring solitary to group activities , Wheeler found that he greatly enjoyed soldiering . For the next seven months , he was posted as an instructor in the University of London Officer Training Corps . It was during this period , in January 1915 , that a son was born to the Wheelers , and named Michael . Michael was their only child , something that was a social anomaly at the time , although it is unknown if this was by choice or not . In May 1915 , Wheeler transferred to the Royal Field Artillery Territorial Force and shortly thereafter was appointed captain . In this position he was stationed at various bases across Britain , often bringing his wife and child with him ; his responsibility was as a battery commander , initially of field guns and later of howitzers .

With the use of a flippant tone and an uncomfortable use of sarcasm , White Dog is Gary 's dissection of the paranoia generated by both racism and classism as he juxtaposes McCarthyism - American , in which there is an obsessive sniffing out of ' subversives ' and violent race riots , against the barricades and race riots of France in 1968 . The violence depicted also provides a discourse on revolutionary social change , as it also leads to a new order , a new reality . Gary excoriates American racism , black activism , and movie - colony liberalism and reflects on American race relations as a whole . He also documents his own intolerance of intolerance that is the curse of tolerance . Through the dog , Gary examines whether a learned response can be unlearned . He also poses the question of how much freedom and uniqueness a person can claim if humans responses are indeed learned by social indoctrination . 
The regular services could be done with a round trip time of nine to ten days , including overnighting in Cairo , Karachi and Bangkok , and with technical revision of the plane in Hong Kong . At first there were semiweekly services , but by the end of 1947 , these had increased to weekly . In June , Braathens SAFE bought a Douglas DC - 3 , LN - PAS Norse Carrier , and in August another DC - 4 , LN - PAW Norse Commander , both from KLM . In 1947 , Braathens SAFE flew twenty - five trips to Hong Kong , five to New York and one to Johannesburg , South Africa , making a profit of NOK 750 , 000 . The following year , Braathens SAFE started the first trial flights to South America . The first flight was made on 23 August from Stavanger via Reykjav k , Gander and Bermuda to Caracas , where the plane landed on 26 August . In October , the airline flew to Panama , but neither route gave sufficient contracts to commence regular services . In 1948 , the airline made fifty trips to Hong Kong , eight to Johannesburg , two to the United States , three to Venezuela and two to Panama .

By the word prerogative we usually understand that special pre - eminence which the King hath , over and above all other persons , and out of the ordinary course of common law , in right of his regal dignity ... it can only be applied to those rights and capacities which the King enjoys alone , in contradiction to others , and not to those which he enjoys in common with any of his subjects .
Scientific understanding of Iguanodon has evolved over time as new information has been obtained from fossils . The numerous specimens of this genus , including nearly complete skeletons from two well - known bonebeds , have allowed researchers to make informed hypotheses regarding many aspects of the living animal , including feeding , movement , and social behaviour . As one of the first scientifically well - known dinosaurs , Iguanodon has occupied a small but notable place in the public 's perception of dinosaurs , its artistic representation changing significantly in response to new interpretations of its remains .
The Good Terrorist was Lessing 's first book to be published after the Canopus in Argos series , which prompted several retorts from reviewers , including , Lessing has returned to Earth , and Lessing returns to reality .

 Marauders is the sixth episode of the second season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : Enterprise , the 32nd episode overall . It first aired on October 30 , 2002 , on the UPN network within the United States . The story was created by executive producers Rick Berman and Brannon Braga with a teleplay by David Wilcox . A similar premise had been included in the original pitch for Star Trek by Gene Roddenberry .
Tech picked up a first down , then Chapman was forced to scramble for a first down after facing third and 10 . Stopped inches short of gaining the first down , Tech risked turning the ball over by attempting to convert the fourth down . Unlike their previous try in the game , Tech was successful and the Hokies ' drive continued . Tech continued to pick up yardage and first downs , advancing deep into the NC State side of the field . Inside the State 30 - yard line , Tech quarterback Chapman was sacked for a 10 - yard loss . He responded by throwing a 30 - yard pass on the next play , driving Virginia Tech inside the State one - yard line . Williams rushed into the end zone with 33 seconds remaining in the quarter , cutting the Wolfpack lead to 21 16 . Virginia Tech elected to attempt a two - point conversion , which was unsuccessful .
Banksia violacea is rarely cultivated . It is a slow - growing plant that tends to become untidy with age , and generally does not flower until four to five years after sprouting from seed . Flowers are an unusual colour , but occur within the bush where they grow within and are usually obscured by foliage . It tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage , except for the variant with a lignotuber , which may be pruned heavily . George recommends a sunny position in light , sandy soil . Professor Margaret Bernard Sedgley of the Waite Institute suggests the species is of no value to floriculture , as the inflorescences are too small and obscured by the foliage , although she does add that the purple colour may be a worthwhile character to select for in plant breeding . Seeds do not require any treatment , and take 19 to 50 days to germinate .

From 1976 to 1979 , the group lived in campgrounds , usually in the Rocky Mountains or Texas . Applewhite and Nettles began to place greater demands on their followers ' heretofore loosely structured lives , which improved membership retention . They typically communicated with their disciples in writing or through assistants . Increasingly , they emphasized that they were the only source of truth the idea that members could receive individual revelations was rejected in an attempt to prevent schisms . Applewhite also sought to prevent close friendships among his followers , fearing that this could lead to insubordination . Applewhite and Nettles insisted that their followers practice what they referred to as flexibility : strict obedience to their often shifting requests . The two leaders limited the group 's contacts with those outside the movement , even some who may have been interested in joining , ostensibly to prevent infiltration from hostile parties . In practice , this made their followers completely dependent upon them . Applewhite instructed his disciples to be like children or pets in their submission their sole responsibility was to obey their leaders . Members were encouraged to constantly seek Applewhite 's advice and often ask themselves what their leaders would do when making a decision . To his followers , he did not seem dictatorial : many of them found him laid back and fatherly . In his 2000 study of the group , Winston Davis states that Applewhite mastered the fine art of religious entertainment , noting that many of his disciples seemed to enjoy their service . Applewhite organized seemingly arbitrary rituals that were intended to instill a sense of discipline in his followers ; he referred to these tasks as games . He also watched science - fiction television programs with the rest of the group . Rather than issue direct commands , he attempted to express his preferences and nominally offer his disciples a choice . He emphasized that students were free to disobey if they chose , in what Lalich dubs the illusion of choice .
Around the same time that NY 93 was rerouted , NY 270 was also extended northward along Junction Road from NY 31 to US 104 . As a result , NY 93 overlapped NY 270 between Lower Mountain Road and US 104 . The overlap with NY 270 remained in place until c . 1963 when NY 270 was truncated southward to the intersection of Lower Mountain and Junction roads . NY 93 was realigned in the late 1970s to bypass Lower Mountain and Gothic Hill Roads on Junction and Upper Mountain roads , replacing NY 270 along Junction Road . The Lower Mountain Road portion of NY 93 's former routing is now maintained by Niagara County as County Route 902 CR 902 .

The black - tailed jackrabbit does not migrate or hibernate during winter and uses the same habitat of 0 . 4 to 1 . 2 mi2 1 3 km2 year - round . Its diet is composed of various shrubs , small trees , grasses , and forbs . Shrubs generally comprise the bulk of fall and winter diets , while grasses and forbs are used in spring and early summer , but the pattern and plant species vary with climate . The black - tailed jackrabbit is an important prey species for raptors and carnivorous mammals , such as eagles , hawks , owls , coyotes , foxes , and wild cats . The rabbits host many ectoparasites including fleas , ticks , lice , and mites ; for this reason , hunters often avoid collecting them .
In the Philippines , officials evacuated over 14 , 000 people . Imbudo was the strongest typhoon to strike since Typhoon Zeb five years prior , The typhoon left widespread areas flooded for several days .

The French - American - British FAB classification system divides AML into eight subtypes , M0 through to M7 , based on the type of cell from which the leukemia developed and its degree of maturity . This is done by examining the appearance of the malignant cells with light microscopy and or by using cytogenetics to characterize any underlying chromosomal abnormalities . The subtypes have varying prognoses and responses to therapy . Although the WHO classification see above may be more useful , the FAB system is still widely used .
The regiment saw its final action at the Battle of P 'ohang - dong , fighting unsuccessfully to take the town from U.N. troops . Racked by U.N. naval and air forces and suffering extensive losses from continuous fighting , the regiment was forced to retreat from the P 'ohang - dong battlefield . It moved north , joining a concentration of other KPA units , before being disbanded and absorbed into the KPA 's 12th Division .
Starlings ' droppings can contain the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum , the cause of histoplasmosis in humans . At roosting sites this fungus can thrive in accumulated droppings . There are a number of other infectious diseases that can potentially be transmitted by common starlings to humans , although the potential for the birds to spread infections may have been exaggerated .
In 2013 and 2014 , auction house sales demonstrated the high cultural value attached to Dylan 's mid - 1960s work , and the record prices that collectors were willing to pay for artefacts from this period .

The Portuguese forces were under the command of General Ant nio Augusto dos Santos , a man with strong faith in new counter - insurgency theories . Augusto dos Santos supported a collaboration with Rhodesia to create African Scout units and other special forces teams , with Rhodesian forces even conducting their own independent operations during the conflict . Due to Portuguese policy of retaining up - to - date equipment for the metropole while shipping obsolete equipment to the colonies , the Portuguese soldiers fighting in the opening stages of the conflict were equipped with World War II radios and the old Mauser rifle . As the fighting progressed , the need for more modern equipment was rapidly recognised , and the Heckler Koch G3 and FN FAL rifles were adopted as the standard battlefield weapon , along with the AR - 10 for paratroopers . The MG42 and , then in 1968 , the HK21 were the Portuguese general purpose machine guns , with 60 , 81 and 120 mm mortars , howitzers and the AML - 60 , Panhard EBR , Fox and Chaimite armoured cars frequently deployed for fire support .

After the war Wi niowiecki engaged in a number of conflicts with neighbouring magnates and nobles . Jeremi was able to afford a sizable private army of several thousands , and through the threat of it he was often able to force his neighbours to a favourable settlement of disputes . Soon after his return from the Russian front , he participated on the side of the Dowmont family in the quarrel over the estate of Dowmont w against another magnate , Samuel aszcz , located on his lands ; soon after the victorious battle against aszcz he bought the lands from the Dowmonts and incorporated them into his estates .
All seven PCI Express x16 slots in the Asus P6T7 motherboard were used in the building of the Fastra II computer . However , the video cards in the Fastra II are wide enough to require two such slots each . To solve this issue , the researchers came up with flexible PCI Express cables , and Tones developed a custom cage which allowed the video cards to suspend over the motherboard .

Several species initially classified within or referred to Allosaurus do not belong within the genus . A. medius was named by Marsh in 1888 for various specimens from the Early Cretaceous of Maryland , although most of the remains were removed by Richard Swann Lull to the new ornithopod species Dryosaurus grandis , except for a tooth . Gilmore considered the tooth nondiagnostic but transferred it to a new species , Dryptosaurus medius . The referral was not accepted in the most recent review , and Allosaurus medius was simply listed as a dubious species of theropod . Allosaurus sibiricus was described in 1914 by A. N. Riabinin on the basis of a bone , later identified as a partial fourth metatarsal , from the Early Cretaceous of Buryatia , Russia . It was transferred to Chilantaisaurus in 1990 .
Fossil records indicate that in pre - Polynesian times , the kakapo was New Zealand 's third most common bird and it was widespread on all three main islands . However , the kakapo population in New Zealand has declined massively since human settlement of the country . Since 1891 , conservation efforts have been made to prevent extinction . The most successful scheme has been the Kakapo Recovery Programme ; this was implemented in 1989 and continues .

When on 25 June 1788 Margaret Sullivan was hanged and burned for coining , the same newspaper by then called The Times wrote :
Zygoballus sexpunctatus is similar in appearance to Zygoballus rufipes , with whom its range overlaps . The male can be distinguished from Z. rufipes by the large spot of white scales at the beginning of the thoracic slope which is lacking in Z. rufipes , and by the longitudinal division present on the bulb of the pedipalp Z. rufipes has a transverse division . The female can best be distinguished by the form of the epigyne the external genital structure .
The change of government was welcome particularly to the senators , who had been harshly persecuted during Domitian 's reign .

When Barbie first came out , she was the subject of a lot of criticism , some of which that claimed Barbie was too mature - looking for children . Midge was the first same - size friend of Barbie ever sold , and was created to oppose these controversies aimed at Barbie . She had a fuller , gentler face mold that was less sexually intimidating , although her body proportions were the same as Barbie and they both stood at 11 1 2 inches 290 mm tall . This allowed the two dolls to be able to share clothes and accessories . Her head mold was stamped 1958 , the same as Barbie . When Midge arrived , the markings on the straight leg body mold they shared changed to include both her and Barbie . Midge had shoulder - length hair that flipped at the ends . Buyers had an option of buying a doll with one of three different hair colors : red , blond , or brunette . Her face was usually brushed with freckles . The dolls that were sold without freckles had a longer hair style and are now hard to find . Depending on the doll 's hair color , the color of her two - piece swimming suit varied . If Midge had red hair her swimsuit was yellow and orange , for blond hair it was in two shades of blue , and if she was brunette it was pink and red . The first vintage Midge dolls had a value of 175 MIB Mint In Box in 2007 .

Predators on the breeding grounds include feral and domestic cats , introduced American mink , feral ferrets , otters and red foxes , and birds including the common buzzard and hooded crow . In Lithuania , the introduced raccoon dog has also been recorded as taking corn crakes . When chicks are exposed by rapid mowing , they may be taken by large birds including the white stork , harriers and other birds of prey , gulls and corvids . At undisturbed sites nests and broods are rarely attacked , as reflected in a high breeding success . There is a record of a corn crake on migration through Gabon being killed by a black sparrowhawk .
Motorised rifle divisions were organized along the Soviet model with three motorised rifle regiments , one tank regiment , and a full complement of 12 , 000 infantry soldiers . The artillery , antitank , and air defence regiments of divisions provided specialised fire support that enabled motorised rifle and tank regiments to maneuver . The air defense regiments consisted of two anti - aircraft artillery battalions and one surface - to - air missile SAM battalion , each composed of several batteries . In the late 1980s the artillery regiments of motorised rifle and tank divisions included two artillery battalions , one multiple rocket launcher battalion , and one surface - to - surface missile battalion .
For many years , Mogadishu stood as the pre - eminent city in the Bilad - ul - Barbar , meaning Land of the Berbers , which was the medieval Arabic term for the Somali coast . By the time of the Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta 's appearance on the Somali coast in 1331 , the city was at the zenith of its prosperity . He described Mogadishu as an exceedingly large city with many rich merchants , which was famous for the high quality fabric that it exported to destinations including Egypt . Batutta added that the city was ruled by a Somali Sultan , Abu Bakr ibn Sayx ' Umar , who was originally from Barbara in northern Somalia and spoke both Somali referred to by Battuta as Mogadishan , the Benadir dialect of Somali and Arabic with equal fluency . The Sultan also had a retinue of wazirs ministers , legal experts , commanders , royal eunuchs , and other officials at his service .
Keshiraja was a notable writer and grammarian of the 13th century . He came from a family of famous poet - writers . Although five of Keshiraja 's writings are not traceable , his most enduring work on Kannada grammar , Shabdamanidarpana Mirror of Word Jewels , 1260 , is available and testifies to his scholarly acumen and literary taste . True to his wish that his writing on grammar should last as long as the sun , the moon , the oceans and the Meru mountain lasted , Shabdamanidarpana is popular even today and is considered a standard authority on old Kannada grammar . It is prescribed as a textbook for students of graduate and post - graduate studies in the Kannada language . Although Keshiraja followed the model of Sanskrit grammar of the Katantra school and that of earlier writings on Kannada grammar by King Amoghavarsha I of the 9th century and grammarian Nagavarma II of 1145 , his work has originality . Keshiraja 's lost writings are Cholapalaka Charitam , Sri Chitramale , Shubhadraharana , Prabodhachandra and Kiratam or Kiratarjuniyam .
The corn crake breeds from Britain and Ireland east through Europe to central Siberia . Although it has vanished from much of its historic range , this bird was once found in suitable habitats in Eurasia everywhere between latitudes 41 N and 62 N. There is also a sizable population in western China , but this species nests only rarely in northern Spain and in Turkey . Old claims of breeding in South Africa are incorrect , and result from misidentification of eggs in a museum collection which are actually those of the African rail .
Excavation for the powerhouse was carried out simultaneously with the excavation for the dam foundation and abutments . A U - shaped structure located at the downstream toe of the dam , its excavation was completed in late 1933 with the first concrete placed in November 1933 . Filling of Lake Mead began February 1 , 1935 , even before the last of the concrete was poured that May . The powerhouse was one of the projects uncompleted at the time of the formal dedication on September 30 , 1935 a crew of 500 men remained to finish it and other structures . To make the powerhouse roof bombproof , it was constructed of layers of concrete , rock , and steel with a total thickness of about 3 . 5 feet 1 . 1 m , topped with layers of sand and tar .
During the next two seasons , however , Hamels suffered through several injuries , and pitched only sparingly . He missed most of the 2004 season with elbow tendinitis , making only four starts .

Olivier directed his third Shakespeare film in September 1954 , Richard III 1955 , which he co - produced with Korda . The presence of four theatrical knights in the one film Olivier was joined by Cedric Hardwicke , Gielgud and Richardson led an American reviewer to dub it An - All - Sir - Cast . The critic for The Manchester Guardian described the film as a bold and successful achievement , but it was not a box - office success , which accounted for Olivier 's subsequent failure to raise the funds for a planned film of Macbeth . He won a BAFTA award for the role and was nominated for the Best Actor Academy Award , which Yul Brynner won .
Protesters in Boston , Los Angeles , Pittsburgh , Toronto , Edinburgh , London , and other cities worldwide , wore Guy Fawkes masks modeled after the 2005 film V for Vendetta . Guy Fawkes was an English Catholic executed for a 1605 attempt to destroy the House of Lords . In V for Vendetta , a rebel against a near - future fascist regime uses the mask in his public appearances and distributes many of its copies to the population to enable mass protests . The Boston Globe characterized usage of the Guy Fawkes masks as an allusion to the British insurgent and a film depicting an antigovernment movement . Aaron Tavena of College Times wrote that the Guy Fawkes masks provided a dramatic effect to the protests , and Nick Jamison of The Retriever Weekly wrote : During the February 10 protests , Anonymous was informative , Anonymous was peaceful , and Anonymous was effective . After seeing all of the pictures from the 10th with everyone in disguise , many sporting Guy Fawkes masks , I wanted to be a part of that . Scott Stewart of University of Nebraska at Omaha 's The Gateway wrote : Many participants sported Guy Fawkes masks to draw attention both to their identity as Anonymous and the Church of Scientology 's abuse of litigation and coercion to suppress anti - Scientology viewpoints .

Isabella and her main work have been subjected to criticism over the course of the twentieth century . Elizabeth David complains of recipes that are sometimes slapdash and misleading , although she acknowledges that Prosper Montagn 's Larousse Gastronomique also contains errors . The television cook Delia Smith admits she was puzzled how on earth Mrs Beeton 's book managed to utterly eclipse ... Acton 's superior work , while her fellow chef , Clarissa Dickson Wright , opines that It would be unfair to blame any one person or one book for the decline of English cookery , but Isabella Beeton and her ubiquitous book do have a lot to answer for . In comparison , the food writer Bee Wilson opines that disparaging Isabella 's work was only a fashionable stance to take and that the cook 's writing simply makes you want to cook . Christopher Driver , the journalist and food critic , suggests that the relative stagnation and want of refinement in the indigenous cooking of Britain between 1880 and 1930 may instead be explained by the progressive debasement under successive editors , revises and enlargers . David comments that when plain English cooks were active in their kitchens , they followed plain English recipes and chiefly those from the Mrs Beeton books or their derivatives . Dickson Wright considers Beeton to be a fascinating source of information from a social history viewpoint , and Aylett and Ordish consider the work to be the best and most reliable guide for the scholar to the domestic history of the mid - Victorian era .
Gerard was an associate of the anonymous author of the Quadripartitus and the Leges Henrici Primi , two 12th - century law books . The medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury charged Gerard with immorality , avarice and the practice of magic . Gerard encouraged at least one of his clergy to study Hebrew , a language not normally studied at the time . Some chroniclers considered his ownership of a Hebrew psalter to be disturbing , seeing it as a sign of heresy or secret Judaism . Among the sins that Malmesbury imputed to him was the study of Julius Firmicus Maternus , a late Roman astrologer , every morning , which to Malmesbury meant that Gerard was a sorcerer . Malmesbury further claimed that Gerard was lewd and lustful . In Gerard 's favour , Anselm regarded him as learned and highly intelligent . Some verses composed by Gerard survive in unpublished form , now in the British Library manuscript collection as part of manuscript Cotton Titus D.xxiv. A collection of his letters circulated in the mid - 12th century , part of a bequest made to Bec Abbey in 1164 by Philip de Harcourt , the Bishop of Bayeux , but it is now lost .

Harold Innis 's interest in the relationship between empires and colonies was developed in his classic study , The Fur Trade in Canada : An Introduction to Canadian Economic History 1930 . The book chronicles the trade in beaver fur from the early 16th century to the 1920s . Instead of focusing on the heroic European adventurers who explored the Canadian wilderness as conventional histories had done , Innis documents how the interplay of geography , technology and economic forces shaped both the fur trade and Canada 's political and economic destiny . He concludes that the fur trade largely determined Canada 's boundaries adding that the country emerged not in spite of geography but because of it .
Significantly , the treaty did not mention or institute any social reforms that Madero had vaguely promised on previous occasions . It also left the Porfirian state essentially intact . Additionally , Madero supported the unpopular idea that all land disputes were to be settled through the courts , staffed by the old judges , a decision that led to outbreaks of sporadic violence , particularly in rural areas .

Two sections of US 2 are part of the overall Great Lakes Circle Tour GLCT : the segment from the Wisconsin state line near Ironwood to the M 28 junction in Wakefield is part of the Lake Superior Circle Tour LSCT , and the segment from the southern M 35 junction in Escanaba to the eastern terminus in St. Ignace is part of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour LMCT . These two tours were created in May 1986 through a joint effort between MDOT and its counterparts in Wisconsin , Minnesota and Ontario . The section of US 2 between Iron River and Crystal Falls has been named the Iron County Heritage Trail . This Pure Michigan Byway was designated to honor the rich history of two industries that built a state and nation : mining and logging . On August 26 , 2007 , MDOT announced that the section of US 2 that runs concurrently with M 35 in Delta County was being included in the UP Hidden Coast Recreational Heritage Trail .
 Military history of Australia 
In November 1948 , 2nd Battalion , 9th Marines was again reestablished . The final stages of fighting between the Nationalists and the Communists , in the Chinese Civil War also known as the War of Liberation , occurred between 1945 and 1950 . When the fighting escalated , the 2nd Battalion , 9th Marines were ordered to Northern China to evacuate all Americans . This mission was accomplished by March 1949 and after which the battalion was sent to Camp Lejeune , North Carolina and was renamed as the 3rd Battalion , 6th Marine .
Work on two prototypes was authorised in November 1943 , but proposals for alternative engines delayed progress . In 1945 , it was decided that as well as adding another Centaurus - engined prototype , there should be three prototypes with the Napier E.122 a development of the Sabre as Specification S.10 45 . The Ministry believed that this would enable Blackburn to develop their knowledge of aerodynamic and structural design and support the engine development at Napier . However , it was found that the S.10 45 aircraft could only be balanced if the E.122 powerplant was placed behind the pilot . The necessary redesign and 1 , 000 - pound 454 kg weight increase , coupled with the limited funds available to the Royal Navy , meant that it could no longer be justified and the S.10 45 was cancelled on 8 October . While in final design , the Centaurus 77 engine with contra - rotating propellers was cancelled in January 1946 and a conventional 2 , 825 - horsepower 2 , 107 kW Centaurus 57 was substituted . This engine was found to require flexible mounts and was modified into the Centaurus 59 . The vertical stabiliser and rudder had to be enlarged from 33 to 41 square feet 3 . 1 to 3 . 8 m2 to counteract the new engine 's torque . In September 1946 a strength analysis conducted by the Ministry of Supply revealed that the aircraft would require strengthening to serve as a strike fighter and that a costly redesign would be required to bring it up to requirements . This would have made it comparable in weight and performance to the Westland Wyvern which had already flown so no contract was placed for production aircraft .
Diamandis reportedly made producer Liam Howe take 486 vocal takes for The Outsider . Hollywood takes inspiration from Diamandis ' previous obsession with American celebrity culture , while in I Am Not a Robot , her favourite track from the album , she sings to tell herself to accept imperfection , with lines such as you 've been acting awful tough lately , smoking a lot of cigarettes lately ... don 't be so pathetic ; she expected audiences to be able to relate to the song . Numb reflects on the dedication and sacrifice needed during her early years in London ; Oh No ! and Are You Satisfied ? have similar lyrical themes . Oh No ! was a late addition to the track listing , causing some reviews of the album to not include it . The album had initially been scheduled for release in October 2009 , and was delayed by Diamandis ' self - confessed perfectionism .
In common with many small Scottish islands , Papa Stour 's population peaked in the 19th century and has experienced a significant decline since then see e.g. Mingulay . By 1970 the island school had closed and the population had declined to sixteen ' fairly elderly ' residents , but an advertisement in Exchange and Mart reversed the decline . A croft and five sheep were offered free of charge to incomers which brought a flood of applicants . By 1981 the census recorded a population of 33 . However , by 2005 the population had fallen to 20 after serious discord between islanders led to several court cases . A number of people left the island and the school closed . By early 2008 the population had dropped to just nine after a family of seven left . The 2011 census recorded a usually resident population of 15 - during the decade 2011 - 11 Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4 to 103 , 702 .

 Headcase . Immature . Soft . Unprepared . He wouldn t pitch on three - days rest if asked . He 's not a big game pitcher . He sounds like a whiny 7 - year old these were some of the descriptions I heard and read from many Phillies fans following Cole Hamels disappointing 2009 season . Heck , some people even wanted him traded after what he said during the 09 World Series . To the naked eye , Cole just wasn t right two years ago . Fast forward a year later and Hamels all the sudden found his game . He flicked a switch or put his game face on . He was more prepared heading in to 2010 or he was cured from the Verducci effect . 
The earliest evidence of human life in and around the area of Manila is the nearby Angono Petroglyphs dated to around 3000 BC .

In mid - November , the JMA briefly tracked a weak tropical depression near Wake Island . The agency also briefly tracked a tropical depression off the coast of Vietnam on December 16 . It finally dissipated on December 17 , with the pressure and winds unknown . The final system of the year was a tropical depression that originated out of the monsoon trough on December 24 east of the Philippines . After initially moving to the west , it turned to the south , and the JTWC estimated the depression intensified into a tropical storm . During this time , PAGASA classified it as Tropical Storm Zigzag . The system made landfall in northeastern Mindanao and dissipated on December 27 , bringing heavy rainfall .
Over the years Waterfall Gully has been extensively logged , and early agricultural interests saw the cultivation of a variety of introduced species as crops , along with the development of local market gardens and nurseries . Attempts to mine the area were largely unsuccessful , but the region housed one of the state 's earliest water - powered mills , and a weir erected in the early 1880s provided for part of the City of Burnside 's water supply . Today the suburb consists primarily of private residences and parks .

These commenced in 1978 and were finished in 1981 , to mark Bulgaria 's 1300th anniversary . However , it was not until November 1985 , when the contemporary murals were finished , that the church was opened once again for visitors . The church 's ruins have been protected as a national antiquity since 1927 ; in 1967 , they were proclaimed an architectural monument of culture of national importance .

The Confession starts with the doctrine of revelation , or how people can know about God . The divines believed knowledge of God was available to people through nature as well as the Bible , but they also believed that the Bible , or Scripture , is the only way in which people attain saving knowledge of God . The doctrine of Scripture was also a particularly important area of debate at the time . Scholars had begun to argue that the Hebrew vowel points , marks added to the text to aid in pronunciation , of the Old Testament were probably not part of the original . This caused significant debate between Reformed polemicists and Roman Catholics . Catholics argued that such a discovery demonstrated the need for an authoritative magisterium to interpret the Bible as opposed to the Protestant doctrine of perspicuity , that the essential teachings of the Bible could be interpreted by anyone . English Reformed writers in particular took up the work of defending the Reformed doctrine . The divines had a strong view of the inspiration of the Bible , and believed that God revealed himself in the propositions found in Scripture . While the issue of biblical inerrancy , the belief that there are no errors in the Bible , did not arise until the eighteenth century , the divines clearly did not believe the Bible to contain any errors . Many of the divines held a rather mechanical view of biblical inspiration , believing that not only the words and ideas but also the letters and vowel points of the Hebrew text were inspired by God . On the other hand , they acknowledged that the text was written by humans in their own styles . They did not make any distinction between essential and incidental matters with respect to biblical inspiration .

The game 's battle system is the series ' trademark Linear Motion Battle System LMBS , which places up to four playable characters on a 2D plain against enemies in real - time combat similar to a beat ' em up . The version used in Destiny 2 is called the Trust and Tactical LMBS . When entering battle , the camera follows characters , zooming in and out depending on their distance from an enemy . During battle , one character is controlled at any one time , with the others being governed by the game 's artificial intelligence AI : the AI can be customized to behave in various ways , such as adjusting their aggression level , and balancing magical and physical attacks . In addition to real - time commands given in battle , the player can issue commands to all characters by pulling up the battle menu and issuing commands . A character 's performance in battle is governed by their current level of Spirit Points SP : the more SP a character has , the higher their defensive and offensive abilities . A character 's health is represented by Health Points HP . Three types of attack are available and activated progressively depending on the number of hits an enemy has taken : a standard attack , named attacks called Artes , and special high - damage attacks called Mystic Artes . At the end of each battle , its performance is assessed an given a Grade , which can sometimes trigger a bonus such as learning new skills . Some bonuses are also carried over into the next playthrough . In addition to the single - player functions , a local multiplayer option is available , supporting up to four players : when additional controllers with players are connected to the system , AI functions for selected characters are disabled , switching to manual control . An auto - battle option , which has the game 's AI controlling all characters during a fight , is also available .
The term Wicca appears to have developed within the Pagan Witchcraft community during the early 1960s , as increasing numbers of Pagan Witches learned of the Old English term wicca , the etymological origin of the Modern term witch . This etymological fact had been referred to five times in Gerald Gardner 's book The Meaning of Witchcraft 1959 , as well as in other early texts propagating Pagan Witchcraft , such as Doreen Valiente 's Where Witchcraft Lives 1962 and Justine Glass ' Witchcraft , The Sixth Sense and Us 1965 . None of these specifically referred to the Pagan Witchcraft religion as Wicca .

Angry with Deepe for airing Kh nh 's grievances against him , Taylor invited every other US journalist in Saigon to this private briefing . Taylor gave the journalists his account of the dispute and discussions with the generals , and hoped it would be useful background information for the media , so they would understand what he had done and not reach negative conclusions about his conduct in their writing . Due to the sensitivity of the situation , he asked them to keep the remarks off the record . However , someone at the briefing informed Deepe of what Taylor had said , and she published the remarks on December 25 under the title Taylor Rips Mask Off Kh nh . In this article , comments were also attributed to Taylor describing some South Vietnamese officers as borderline nuts and accusing many generals of staying in Saigon and allowing their junior officers to run the war as they saw fit . Deepe 's article caused an uproar due to the tension between Taylor and the Vietnamese generals .
Studies suggest antiparasitic treatment leads to parasitological cure in more than 90 of infants but only about 60 85 of adults treated in the first year of acute phase Chagas disease . Children aged six to 12 years with chronic disease have a cure rate of about 60 with benznidazole . While the rate of cure declines the longer an adult has been infected with Chagas , treatment with benznidazole has been shown to slow the onset of heart disease in adults with chronic Chagas infections .
It seems that the kakapo like many of New Zealand 's bird species has evolved to occupy an ecological niche normally filled by various species of mammal the only non - marine mammals native to New Zealand are three species of small bats . Before the arrival of humans , the kakapo was distributed throughout the three main islands of New Zealand . It lived in a variety of habitats , including tussocklands , scrublands and coastal areas . It also inhabited forests , including those dominated by podocarps rimu , matai , kahikatea , totara , beeches , tawa , and rata . In Fiordland , areas of avalanche and slip debris with regenerating and heavily fruiting vegetation such as five finger , wineberry , bush lawyer , tutu , hebes , and coprosmas became known as kakapo gardens .

Qin Hui , an official of the Song court , recommended a peaceful solution to the conflict in 1130 , saying that , If it is desirable that there will be no more conflicts under Heaven , it is necessary for the southerners to stay in the south and the northerners in the north . Gaozong , who considered himself a northerner , initially rejected the proposal . There were gestures toward peace in 1132 , when the Jin freed an imprisoned Song diplomat , and in 1133 , when the Song offered to become a Jin vassal , but a treaty never materialized . The Jin requirement that the border between the two states be moved south from the Huai River to the Yangtze was too large of a hurdle for the two sides to reach an agreement .
In all 416 , 806 Australians enlisted in the AIF during the war and 333 , 000 served overseas . 61 , 508 were killed and another 155 , 000 were wounded a total casualty rate of 65 . The financial cost to the Australian government was calculated at 376 , 993 , 052 . Two referendums on conscription for overseas service had been defeated during the war , preserving the volunteer status of the Australian force , but stretching the reserves of manpower available , particularly towards the end of the fighting . Consequently , Australia remained one of only two armies on either side not to resort to conscription during the war .

Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy . The K tetsu Japanese : , literally Ironclad , later renamed Azuma , East had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869 , which marked the end of the Boshin War , and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration . The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards , first ironclads and later armored cruisers . These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was superior on paper at least at the Battle of the Yalu River . Thanks to superior short - range firepower , the Japanese fleet came off better , sinking or severely damaging eight ships and receiving serious damage to only four . The naval war was concluded the next year at the Battle of Weihaiwei , where the strongest remaining Chinese ships were surrendered to the Japanese .

Following the reign of the Han dynasty , 202 BC 220 AD , the idea of the Buddhist stupa entered Chinese culture , as a means to house and protect scriptural sutras . During the Southern and Northern Dynasties period , the distinctive Chinese pagoda was developed , its predecessors being the tall watch towers and towering residential apartments of the Han dynasty as inferred from models in Han - era tombs . During the Sui 581 618 and Tang 618 907 periods , Chinese pagodas were developed from purely wooden structures to use articulated stone and brick , which could more easily survive fires caused by lightning or arson and were less susceptible to decay . The earliest brick pagoda that remains extant is the Songyue Pagoda , built in 523 , and a typical example of a Tang - era stone pagoda is the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda , constructed in 652 . Although Buddhist influences on China waned after the late Tang period , numerous Buddhist pagoda towers were built during the Song dynasty . Tall Chinese pagodas were often built in the countryside rather than within a city 's walls , largely to avoid competition with the cosmic - imperial authority embodied in the cities ' drum- and gate - towers . The Giant Wild Goose Pagoda , built in a city ward of what was southeastern Chang 'an , is among the exceptions .
In his statement Abu - Jamal criticized his attorney as a legal trained lawyer who was imposed on him against his will and who knew he was inadequate to the task and chose to follow the directions of this black - robed conspirator , Albert Sabo , even if it meant ignoring my directions . He claimed that his rights had been deceitfully stolen from him by Sabo , particularly focusing on the denial of his request to receive defense assistance from non - attorney John Africa and being prevented from proceeding pro se . He quoted remarks of John Africa , and said :
Because a 129Xe nucleus has a spin of 1 2 , and therefore a zero electric quadrupole moment , the 129Xe nucleus does not experience any quadrupolar interactions during collisions with other atoms , and thus its hyperpolarization can be maintained for long periods of time even after the laser beam has been turned off and the alkali vapor removed by condensation on a room - temperature surface . Spin polarization of 129Xe can persist from several seconds for xenon atoms dissolved in blood to several hours in the gas phase and several days in deeply frozen solid xenon . In contrast , 131Xe has a nuclear spin value of 3 2 and a nonzero quadrupole moment , and has t1 relaxation times in the millisecond and second ranges .

The High King was said to preside over the provincial kingdoms that together formed Ireland . All of these kingdoms had their own kings but were at least nominally subject to the High King . The High King was drawn from the ranks of the provincial kings and ruled also the royal kingdom of Meath , with a ceremonial capital at the Hill of Tara . The concept only became a political reality in the Viking Age and even then was not a consistent one . Ireland did have a culturally unifying rule of law : the early written judicial system , the Brehon Laws , administered by a professional class of jurists known as the brehons . However , a united kingdom of Gaelic Ireland was never achieved .
However he struggled with poor form during the 1950 51 season as his first marriage was coming to an end and he came into increasing conflict with his teammates . He was angered when the club sold Jackie Sewell to Sheffield Wednesday in March 1951 breaking Lawton 's own transfer record in the process as he felt the move showed a lack of ambition from the club 's directors . He also found that the well paid job he was promised outside of football did not transpire . His tally of nine goals in 31 games in 1950 51 and 13 goals in 31 games in 1951 52 was disappointing , and he was made available for transfer .

Despite some earlier ideas about a permanent department store building on the same spot , and a 1977 architecture competition for its design , no construction took place . Instead , the parcel was turned into a parking lot , which it remains to this day .
The gray wolf and the cougar compete more directly for prey , especially in winter . Wolves can steal kills and occasionally kill the cat . One report describes a large pack of 7 to 11 wolves killing a female cougar and her kittens . Conversely , lone female or young wolves are vulnerable to predation , and have been reported ambushed and killed by cougars . Various accounts of cougars killing lone wolves , including a six - year - old female , have also been documented . Wolves more broadly affect cougar population dynamics and distribution by dominating territory and prey opportunities , and disrupting the feline 's behavior . Preliminary research in Yellowstone , for instance , has shown displacement of the cougar by wolves . In nearby Sun Valley , Idaho , a cougar wolf encounter that resulted in the death of the cougar was documented . One researcher in Oregon noted : When there is a pack around , cougars are not comfortable around their kills or raising kittens ... A lot of times a big cougar will kill a wolf , but the pack phenomenon changes the table . 
During the courting season , males leave their home ranges for hilltops and ridges where they establish their own mating courts . These leks can be up to 7 kilometres 4 mi from a kakapo 's usual territory and are an average of 50 metres 160 ft apart within the lek arena . Males remain in the region of their court throughout the courting season . At the start of the breeding season , males will fight to try to secure the best courts . They confront each other with raised feathers , spread wings , open beaks , raised claws and loud screeching and growling . Fighting may leave birds with injuries or even kill them .

The Peach Bowl was the final game as head coach of Virginia Tech for Bill Dooley , who had accumulated a record of 62 38 1 for the Hokies since assuming the head coaching job in 1978 . Tech president William Lavery had long disagreed with Dooley about the role of football at Virginia Tech , and prior to the beginning of the season , Lavery told Dooley that his tenure as coach would end on January 1 , 1987 . This fact was revealed to the football team and the general public after Tech 's third game of the season .

Facing Dooley across the field was NC State head coach Dick Sheridan , who in his first year as head coach of the Wolfpack , was named Atlantic Coast Conference coach of the year and guided the Wolfpack to eight wins .
Following a dispute with the British government regarding terms for the granting of full independence , the predominantly white minority government of the self - governing colony of Rhodesia or Southern Rhodesia , led by Ian Smith , unilaterally declared independence on 11 November 1965 . Britain and the United Nations refused to recognise this and each imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia . Meanwhile , the country 's two most prominent communist - backed black nationalist groups , the Zimbabwe African National Union and the Zimbabwe African People 's Union , mobilised their respective guerrilla armies , the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army ZANLA and the Zimbabwe People 's Revolutionary Army ZIPRA , for what they called the Second Chimurenga , with the goal of overthrowing the government and introducing black majority rule .

The mountains are about 150 miles 240 km directly southwest of Boise , Idaho , and about 190 miles 310 km northeast of Reno , Nevada .
The deities with the most limited and specialized domains are often called minor divinities or demons in modern writing , although there is no firm definition for these terms . Among these lesser deities , Egyptologist Claude Traunecker draws a distinction between genies specialized patron spirits of certain places , objects , or activities , such as the sea or marsh god Wadj - Wer and the harvest goddess Renenutet and demons , who have a more dangerous character . Many demons are hostile , causing illness and other troubles among humans . Their power can also be protective ; they may guard certain places in the Duat , the realm of the dead , or advise and watch over humans . Egyptians believed the landscape was full of these unpredictable divine powers . Demons often act as servants and messengers to the greater gods , but their position in the hierarchy is not fixed . The protective deities Bes and Taweret originally had minor , demon - like roles , but over time they came to be credited with great influence .
When the weather was right , the force would cross the English Channel in darkness and attack shortly after midnight to coincide with the Zeebrugge Raid a few miles up the coast .

Survivalism and disaster preparation are prevalent themes in the novel . Several interviews , especially those from the United States , focus on policy changes designed to train the surviving Americans to fight the zombies and rebuild the country . For example , when cities were made to be as efficient as possible in order to fight the zombies , the plumber could hold a higher status than the former C.E.O. ; when the ultra - rich hid in their homes , which had been turned into fortified compounds , they were overwhelmed by others trying to get in , leading to mass slaughter . Throughout the novel , characters demonstrate the physical and mental requirements needed to survive a disaster . Brooks described the large amount of research needed to find optimal methods for fighting a worldwide zombie outbreak . He also pointed out that Americans like the zombie genre because they believe they can survive anything with the right tools and talent .
Baibars ventured into the area around Krak des Chevaliers in 1270 and allowed his men to graze their animals on the fields around the castle . When he received news that year of the Eighth Crusade led by King Louis IX of France , Baibars left for Cairo to avoid a confrontation . After Louis died in 1271 Baibars returned to deal with Krak des Chevaliers . Before he marched on the castle the Sultan captured the smaller castles in the area , including Chastel Blanc . On 3 March , Baibars ' army arrived at Krak des Chevaliers . By the time the Sultan appeared on the scene , the castle may already have been blockaded by Mamluk forces for several days . Of the three Arabic accounts of the siege only one was contemporary , that of Ibn Shaddad , although he was not present at the siege . Peasants who lived in the area had fled to the castle for safety and were kept in the outer ward . As soon as Baibars arrived he erected mangonels , powerful siege weapons which he would later turn on the castle . In a probable reference to a walled suburb outside the castle 's entrance , Ibn Shaddad records that two days later the first line of defences fell to the besiegers .

Within the many poems that explore this idea among them Keats 's and the works by his contemporaries Keats begins by questioning suffering , breaks it down to its most basic elements of cause and effect , and draws conclusions about the world . His own process is filled with doubt , but his poems end with a hopeful message that the narrator himself is finally free of desires for Love , Ambition , and Poesy . The hope contained within Ode on Indolence is found within the vision he expresses in the last stanza : I yet have visions for the night And for the day faint visions there is store . Consequently , in her analysis of The Odes of John Keats , Helen Vendler suggests that Ode on Indolence is a seminal poem constructed with themes and images that appeared more influential in his other , sometimes later , poems . The ode is an early and entirely original work that establishes the basis of Keats 's notion of soul making , a method by which the individual builds his or her soul through a form of education consisting of suffering and personal experience . This is a fundamental preoccupation of the Romantics , who believed the way to reconcile man and nature was through this soul development , education the combination of experience and contemplation and that only this process , not the rationality of the previous century , would bring about true Enlightenment .
Despite the Devin Townsend Project being originally a four - album series , Townsend decided to continue working under the moniker and released the fifth album , Epicloud on September 18 , 2012 . Again featuring Anneke van Giersbergen on vocals , Epicloud appeared on several European charts , peaking at number 8 in Finland . On October 27 , 2012 , Devin Townsend performed a one - off show covering his musical career called The Retinal Circus at Roundhouse in London . The 3 - hour performance was recorded in high definition and released on DVD and Blu - ray on September 30 , 2013 . Also in 2012 , Townsend played bass on the debut Bent Sea album Noistalgia . He also produced the record .
The ship 's secondary armament consisted of fourteen 45 - calibre 6 - inch 152 mm quick - firing QF guns mounted in casemates . Eight of these guns were positioned on the main deck and the other six guns were placed above them in the superstructure . They fired 100 - pound 45 kg shells at a muzzle velocity of 2 , 300 ft s 700 m s . Protection against torpedo - boat attacks was provided by twenty QF 12 - pounder 12 cwt guns . The 12 - pounders fired 3 - inch 76 mm , 12 . 5 - pound 5 . 7 kg projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 , 359 ft s 719 m s . Lighter guns consisted of eight 47 - millimetre 1 . 9 in three - pounder Hotchkiss guns and four 47 - millimetre 2 . 5 - pounder Hotchkiss guns . The former were mounted in the superstructure and the latter in the fighting tops . The three - pounder gun fired 3 . 19 - pound 1 . 45 kg projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 1 , 927 ft s 587 m s , while the 2 . 5 - pounder fired 2 . 5 - pound 1 . 1 kg shells at a muzzle velocity of 1 , 420 ft s 430 m s . The ship was also equipped with four submerged 18 - inch torpedo tubes , two on each broadside .
Several critics including both Kilmer 's contemporaries and modern scholars have disparaged Kilmer 's work as being too religious , simple , overly sentimental , and suggested that his style was far too traditional , even archaic . Poet Conrad Aiken , a contemporary of Kilmer , lambasted his work as being unoriginal merely imitative with a sentimental bias and trotting out of the same faint passions , the same old heartbreaks and love songs , ghostly distillations of fragrances all too familiar . Aiken characterized Kilmer as a dabbler in the pretty and sweet and pale - mouthed clingers to the artificial and archaic .

The production s incredible . The beat is just so constant and powerful . That was the first song that I wrote with Dimitri and Maya . I felt like I d found my sound . And I was kind of looking at it like an outfit . So it was , if this was an outfit , what would this song need now ? So we had the pretty dress , which was the chorus . We had the lovely shoes , which was the verse . But what do we need to really set this song off ? A big , fancy , bow in the hair would really set this song off . So when I got to the middle eight I wanted to go really erratic , almost like taTu on All The Things She Said . I wanted it to be proper fucked up and crazy hands in the air .
Defender Keith Lowe , of Cheltenham , and goalkeeper Nick Pope , of Charlton Athletic , were signed on loan until January 2014 . They both played in York 's first league defeat in four weeks , 2 1 away , to Southend United . Kevan Hurst gave Southend the lead early into the match and Bowman equalised for York with a low strike during the second half , before Luke Prosser scored the winning goal for the home side in stoppage time . With Pope preferred in goal , Kettings returned to Blackpool on his own accord , although his loan agreement would stay in place until January 2014 . York then drew 0 0 away to Morecambe . After Pope was recalled from his loan by Charlton , York signed Wolverhampton Wanderers goalkeeper Aaron McCarey on loan until January 2014 . McCarey kept a clean sheet in York 's 0 0 home draw with Rochdale .
After the war , the military service of Hawaiians , including Henry Ho olulu Pitman , were largely forgotten , disappearing from the collective memories of the American Civil War and the history of Hawai i . However , in recent years , Hawaiian residents and historians and descendants of Hawaiian combatants in the conflict have insisted on the need to remember our boys from Hawaii . Renewed interest in the stories of these individuals and this particular period of Hawaiian - American history have inspired efforts to preserve the memories of the Hawaiians who served in the war . On August 26 , 2010 , on the anniversary of the signing of the Hawaiian Neutrality Proclamation , a bronze plaque was erected along the memorial pathway at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu recognizing these Hawai i Sons of the Civil War , the more than one hundred documented Hawaiians who served during the American Civil War for both the Union and the Confederacy . Pitman 's great - grandniece Diane Kino ole o Liliha Pitman Spieler attended the ceremony . Pitman Spieler stated , I 'm very proud of a young man of his age he was quite young who served in the Civil War for his family . 
From 1870 until 1901 , each of the six colonial governments was responsible for their own defence . The colonies had gained responsible government between 1855 and 1890 , and while the Colonial Office in London retained control of some affairs , the Governor of the each colony was required to raise their own colonial militia . To do this , they were granted the authority from the British crown to raise military and naval forces . Initially these were militias in support of British regulars , but when military support for the colonies ended in 1870 , the colonies assumed their own defence responsibilities . The colonial military forces included unpaid volunteer militia , paid citizen soldiers , and a small permanent component . They were mainly infantry , cavalry and mounted infantry , and were neither housed in barracks nor subject to full military discipline . Even after significant reforms in the 1870s including the expansion of the permanent forces to include engineer and artillery units they remained too small and unbalanced to be considered armies in the modern sense . By 1885 , the forces numbered 21 , 000 men . Although they could not be compelled to serve overseas many volunteers subsequently did see action in a number conflicts of the British Empire during the 19th century , with the colonies raising contingents to serve in Sudan , South Africa and China .
Andreas Heldal - Lund , founder of the Scientology - critical website and non - profit organization Operation Clambake , released a statement criticizing the digital assault against Scientology . Heldal - Lund commented , People should be able to have easy access to both sides and make up their own opinions . Freedom of speech means we need to allow all to speak - including those we strongly disagree with . I am of the opinion that the Church of Scientology is a criminal organisation and a cult which is designed by its delusional founder to abuse people . I am still committed to fight for their right to speak their opinion . He also stated that Attacking Scientology like that will just make them play the religious persecution card ... They will use it to defend their own counter actions when they try to shatter criticism and crush critics without mercy . 
In line with this goal , the ADF was restructured to increase its ability to strike at enemy forces from Australian bases and to counter raids on continental Australia . This was achieved by increasing the capabilities of the RAN and RAAF , and relocating regular Army units to Northern Australia . During this time the ADF had no military units on operational deployment outside Australia . However , in 1987 the ADF made its first operational deployment as part of Operation Morris Dance , in which several warships and a rifle company deployed to the waters off Fiji in response to the 1987 Fijian coups d ' tat . While broadly successful , this deployment highlighted the need for the ADF to improve its capability to rapidly respond to unforeseen events .
The response of the NDH authorities to resistance had been to burn down the villages where this had occurred , and there were mass shootings of Serbs , which escalated the level of violence even further . In late May and June , 173 Serbs had been rounded up , tortured and killed in Nevesinje , and in early June , another 140 Serbs had been killed at Ljubinje . In response , Serbs attacked Usta e officials and facilities , and conducted raids themselves , killing Muslim villagers .
By extension , any pentadienyl cation regardless of its origin is capable of undergoing a Nazarov cyclization . There have been a large number of examples published where the requisite cation is arrived at by a variety of rearrangements . One such example involves the silver catalyzed cationic ring opening of allylic dichloro cylopropanes . The silver salt facilitates loss of chloride via precipitation of insoluble silver chloride .
A high official named Isesi - ankh could have been yet another son of Djedkare Isesi , as suggested by his name meaning Isesi lives . Yet , similarities in the titles and locations of the tombs of Isesi - ankh and Kaemtjenent have led Egyptologists to propose that they could instead be brothers and sons of Meresankh IV , or that the former is a son of the latter . Even though Isesi - ankh bore the title of king 's son , the Egyptologists Michel Baud and Bettina Schmitz argue that this filiation was fictitious , being only an honorary title .
The gradual development of blue to violet pigmentation as one progresses from species to species is an interesting phenomenon deserving further study . The climax is reached in L. indigo which is blue throughout . L. chelidonium and its variety chelidonioides , L. paradoxus , and L. hemicyaneus may be considered as mileposts along the road to L. indigo .
In May 1951 , he announced he was retiring from professional football to become sports director at a radio station in Buffalo . He was hired as a sportscaster by WBEN now known as WIVB , which had just started the first television station in Buffalo and the only one serving Southern Ontario . This was an early foray into television by the Buffalo Evening News . In the 1950s , Rifenburg hosted a popular panel show called Let 's Talk Sports in Buffalo and also pioneered an early morning exercise program . He also worked for WBEN AM and WBEN FM and as the sideline announcer for Buffalo Bills games along with Van Miller , the long time Bills play - by - play announcer . In addition , he served as the play - by - play announcer for the University of Buffalo Bulls football team . As a radio broadcaster , he is remembered for things ranging from ski reports , to 17 years worth of Breakfast At programs live from various local restaurants , to 27 years as the WBEN - AM All Night Show host .

Following a series of minor victories , the British suffered a major setback during Black Week between 10 17 December 1899 , although no Australian units were involved . The first contingents of infantry from Victoria , South Australia , Western Australia , and Tasmania arrived in Cape Town on 26 November and were designated the Australian Regiment under the command of Colonel John Charles Hoad . With a need for increased mobility , they were soon converted into mounted infantry . Further units from Queensland and New South Wales arrived in December and were soon committed to the front . The first casualties occurred soon after at Sunnyside on 1 January 1900 , after 250 Queensland Mounted Infantry and a column of Canadians , British and artillery attacked a Boer laager at Belmont . Troopers David McLeod and Victor Jones were killed when their patrol clashed with the Boer forward sentries . Regardless , the Boers were surprised and during two hours of heavy fighting , more than 50 were killed and another 40 taken prisoner . Five hundred Queenslanders and the New South Wales Lancers subsequently took part in the Siege of Kimberley in February 1900 .
The Storm was primarily meant to satisfy Israeli military needs , but capable long and short versions are produced for the local civilian market . Like the Jeep , it has a conventional front - engine design with a driver and passenger seated behind the engine , and room for cargo or passengers behind them . It is powered by an AMC 3 . 983 litre 6 - cylinder in - line petrol with fuel injection developing 180 hp 130 kW at 4 , 700 rpm , fitted with Vortox 2 - stage air cleaner or a Volkswagen 2 . 5 litre 4 - cylinder turbocharged diesel developing 88 kilowatts 118 hp at 4 , 200 rpm . The front axle is fully floating and the rear axle is semi - floating , while a reinforced frame and body as well as good angles of approach and departure 40 and 37 for short frame , 40 and 26 . 5 for long frame add to the Storm 's off - roading capability .
The entrance road was constructed from Military Road to the fort 's rear gates . Its path is largely followed by the modern Queen Elizabeth II walk , though the former road was slightly to the south . This walk links the conservation park 's visitor centre to the fort gates ; some of the old road can still be seen close to the gates . What was the muster ground is partly taken up by the caravan and camping park and a car park . It was levelled and filled in the 1950s for this use . What remains of this ground , north of the caravan park , was returned to its 1880s profile in 1993 funded by a Federal Government grant . In the 19th century , the muster ground was used for training of the Volunteer Military Force including artillery , who camped on the site . As designed the fort 's rear was protected with a wooden palisade or stockade . In 1881 a masonry wall was added , greatly strengthening defence . Most of the stockade was reconstructed in the 1970s ; some of the original wooden structure is visible in the fort 's north .
After weakening into a remnant low , Felicia continued to approach the Hawaiian Islands and on August 12 , the system produced copious amounts of rainfall across several islands . The highest total was recorded on Oahu at 14 . 63 in 372 mm , causing isolated mudslides and flooding . In Maui , the heavy rains helped to alleviate drought conditions and water shortages , significantly increasing the total water across the island 's reservoirs . In addition , river flooding resulted in the closure of one school and large swells produced by the storm resulted in several lifeguard rescues at island beaches . In all , only minor impacts were caused by the remnants of Felicia .
In the field , the mushroom is reliably distinguished from the true morels on the basis of cap attachment : V. bohemica has a cap that hangs completely free from the stem . Although widely considered edible , consumption of the mushroom is generally not advised due to reports of poisoning in susceptible individuals . Poisoning symptoms include gastrointestinal upset and lack of muscular coordination . V. bohemica is found in northern North America , Europe , and Asia . It fruits in early spring , growing on the ground in woods following the snowmelt , before the appearance of true morels genus Morchella . The synonym Ptychoverpa bohemica is often used by European mycologists .
Much of Hornung 's work fell out of favour as time passed ; Rowland observed that all of Hornung 's other works have been forgotten , with the possible exception of Stingaree , but the cricketing Cracksman continues to enthral . The idea of a criminal as a positive character was one of Hornung 's legacies , and Twentieth - Century Literary Criticism states that critics have also interpreted Raffles as a prototype of the antihero in modern crime fiction . The academic Frank Wadleigh Chandler , describing Raffles 's death , writes that all his creator 's attempts to portray him as a hero , rather than an anti - hero , deservedly fail . Valentine highlights one aspect of the stories was the mix of devilry and daring demonstrated by Raffles ; in this respect he was a literary forerunner of The Saint , James Bond and other insouciant types . The writer Colin Watson agrees , and called Hornung a precursor of Ian Fleming .
Fowler 's first involvement with the Liverpool first team came on 13 January 1993 , when he was an unused substitute in an FA Cup third round tie against Bolton Wanderers . In the following close season , Fowler helped the England under - 18 team win the 1993 European Championship , before making a scoring first - team debut in Liverpool 's 3 1 win in a first round League Cup tie at Fulham on 22 September 1993 . Fowler scored all five goals in the second leg at Anfield two weeks later , making him the fourth player in Liverpool 's history to score five in a senior fixture . He scored his first league hat - trick against Southampton in only his fifth league game . His very first league goal for the Reds had come on 16 October 1993 , when an 87th - minute equaliser at home to struggling Oldham Athletic saved the Reds from what would have been one of the biggest Premier League shocks of the season , with a last gasp own goal giving Liverpool a 2 1 win . He scored twice in a thrilling 3 3 draw at Tottenham Hotspur on 18 December .

In addition Pasha I also included two trench mortar companies , the 300th Flight Detachment , Wireless detachment , three railway companies and two field hospitals . Austria provided two mountain howitzer batteries of six guns each . With the exception of the two 210 mm howitzers , the trench mortars and the railway personnel the remainder of Pasha I took part in the advance to Romani .
This heavy night and day battle cost the NK 2nd Division most of its remaining offensive strength . The medical officer of the NK 17th Regiment , 2nd Division , captured a few days later , said that the division evacuated about 300 men nightly to a hospital in Pugong - ni , and that in the first two weeks of September the 2nd Division lost 1 , 300 killed and 2 , 500 wounded in the fighting west of Changnyong . Even though its offensive strength was largely spent by September 9 , the division continued to harass rear areas around Changnyong with infiltrating groups as large as companies . Patrols daily had to open the main supply road and clear the town .
Dual Destinies was given a digital - only release in the West . This was partially because of the game 's tight development schedule : by releasing it digitally , Capcom was able to release the English version close to the Japanese release date . Two of the games have not been localized : Ace Attorney Investigations 2 and Dai Gyakuten Saiban , although the former has received a full fan translation .
Opposing the Germans were the old Russian pre - dreadnoughts Slava and Tsesarevich , the armored cruisers Bayan , Admiral Makarov , and Diana , 26 destroyers , and several torpedo boats and gunboats . Three British C - class submarines where also stationed in the Gulf . The Irben Strait , the main southern entrance to the Gulf of Riga , was heavily mined and defended by a number of coastal artillery batteries . The garrison on sel numbered nearly 14 , 000 men , though by 1917 it had been reduced to 60 to 70 percent strength .

Creator Matthew Weiner said Far Away Places was inspired by anthologized French films with lots of short stories in them , with all three short stories linked by a thematic desire to go away . He further explained that Peggy has this moment where she tries to be Don and fails and then goes on Peggy 's version of Don sexually irresponsible , and drunk , and working . Elisabeth Moss said the handjob Peggy gives a stranger in the theatre is a moment of forgetting after the frustrating Heinz pitch .

On August 7 , five Hurricane Hunter planes were dispatched to Hickam Air Force Base to fly missions into the storm . Later that day , the Central Pacific Hurricane Center issued tropical storm watches for the island of Hawaii , Maui , Kahoolawe , Lanai , and Molokai . On August 9 , the watch was expanded to include Oahu . The watches for the Big Island were later cancelled as the forecast track appeared to drift further north toward Maui County and Oahu . The Red Cross opened shelters throughout the islands on August 10 . Twelve were on the Big Island , seven were on Maui , two on Molokai and one on Lanai . The Honolulu International Airport ensured that eight generators were ready for use in case Felicia caused a power outage at the airport . All tropical storm watches were cancelled at 11 a.m. August 11 as Felicia dissipated to a remnant low .
Josephine reached its peak intensity of 65 mph 100 km h around 8 a.m. EDT as it continued to become more organized . However , there were indications that it had already begun to weaken . Outflow towards the north was becoming restricted and arc clouds began emanating from the storm , a sign that dry air was entering the system . During the afternoon hours , the structure of Josephine began to rapidly deteriorate as strong wind shear and dry air took their toll . By the late night , the center was almost completely exposed and only a band of convection persisted near the center .

Archaeologists have established that the monument was built by pastoralist communities shortly after the introduction of agriculture to Britain from continental Europe . Although representing part of an architectural tradition of long barrow building that was widespread across Neolithic Europe , the Coldrum Stones belong to a localised regional variant of barrows produced in the vicinity of the River Medway , now known as the Medway Megaliths . Of these , it is in the best surviving condition , and lies near to both Addington Long Barrow and Chestnuts Long Barrow on the western side of the river . Three further surviving long barrows , Kit 's Coty House , the Little Kit 's Coty House , and the Coffin Stone , are located on the Medway 's eastern side .
On 1 July , an Italian armoured unit arrived in Gacko to reinforce the garrison . An Usta e operation to clear the insurgents from the Stolac district began on 3 July , meeting with success and opening of the road from Berkovci north to Od ak . The Usta e did not go closer to Nevesinje as they were not in uniform , and were concerned that the Home Guards would mistake them for rebels . During this operation , three Usta e were killed , including their commander , and the Usta e fighters killed ten rebels and captured two . In the belongings of one of the captured rebels , the Usta e located a report by the National Movement for the Liberation of Nevesinje Serbo - Croatian : Narodni pokret za oslobo enje Nevesinja , which was apparently how the rebels referred to themselves . The report made it clear that the rebels were using military tactics and organisation , and hinted at co - operation with the Italians . According to information gathered by the police , the local rebel leadership included former Mostar merchant edo Mili , the Bjelogrli brothers from Avtovac , the Orthodox priest Father Mastilovi from Nadini i , and a Captain Radovi from Avtovac . Montenegrins involved in the leadership of the uprising included Colonel Bajo Stani i , Major Minja Vi nji , and Radojica Nik evi from Nik i .
In the DVD documentary The Thunderbirds Companion , Anderson explained how a rise in filming costs had made overseas distribution revenue even more important and essentially caused Thunderbirds to be made as an American show . During the character development and voice casting process , the Andersons ' main priority was to ensure that the series had transatlantic appeal , thus increasing the chances of winning an American network deal and the higher audience figures that this market had to offer . Scripts were typed in American English and printed on US - style quarto - size paper .
The closest relative of H. gammarus is the American lobster , Homarus americanus . The two species are very similar , and can be crossed artificially , although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap . The two species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics :
One day , Zhou surprises the children with a written exam and leaves the classroom to speak with a visitor . Wang 's son , Wang Gui , tricks their maid 's son , Yue Fei , into completing their assignment while they go outside to play . After easily finishing the task at hand , Yue writes a heroic poem on a whitewashed wall and signs it with his name . The children then burst into the classroom upon learning of Zhou 's forthcoming return and tell Yue to escape in order to avoid apprehension . The old teacher eventually discovers the ruse and , after marveling at Yue 's impromptu ballad , asks Yue to fetch his mother , Lady Yao , for an important meeting . With the entire Wang household assembled in the main hall , Zhou asks the Lady for her blessing to have the boy as his adopted son and student . She consents and Yue takes his seat amongst Zhou 's students the following morning . Because Zhou knows Yue is poor , he commands the four students to become sworn brothers . Zhou also begins to teach Yue all of the eighteen weapons of war .
In breeding years , the loud booming calls of the males at their mating arenas made it easy for M ori hunting parties to track the kakapo down , and it was also hunted while feeding or when dust - bathing in dry weather . The bird was caught , generally at night , using snares , pitfall traps , or by groups of domesticated Polynesian dogs which accompanied hunting parties sometimes they would use fire sticks of various sorts to dazzle a bird in the darkness , stopping it in their tracks and making the capture easier . Cooking was done in a h ngi or in gourds of boiling oil . The flesh of the bird could be preserved in its own fat and stored in containers for later consumption hunters of the Ng i Tahu tribe would pack the flesh in baskets made from the inner bark of totara tree or in containers constructed from kelp . Bundles of kakapo tail feathers were attached to the sides of these containers to provide decoration and a way to identify their contents . Also taken by the M ori were the bird 's eggs , which are described as whitish but not pure white , and about the same size as a kerer egg .
At 3 : 55 am on December 9 , 1981 , in Philadelphia , close to the intersection at 13th and Locust Streets , Philadelphia Police Department officer Daniel Faulkner conducted a traffic stop on a vehicle belonging to William Cook , Abu - Jamal 's younger brother . During the traffic stop , Abu - Jamal 's taxi was parked across the street . He ran across the street towards Cook 's car , where Faulkner was shot from behind and then in the face . Abu - Jamal was shot by Faulkner in the stomach . Faulkner died at the scene from the gunshot to his head . Police arrived and arrested Abu - Jamal , who was found wearing a shoulder holster . His revolver , which had five spent cartridges , was beside him . Abu - Jamal was taken directly from the scene of the shooting to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital , where he received treatment for his wound .
Yates and Warren also named Dvinosauria , a clade of small aquatic temnospondyls from the Carboniferous , Permian , and Triassic . They placed Dvinosauria within Limnarchia , but more recent studies disagree on their position . For example , a 2007 study places them even more basal than euskelians , while a 2008 study keeps them as basal limnarchians .

On 12 October 1643 , Parliament ordered the Assembly to cease work on the Thirty - Nine Articles and to begin to frame a common form of church government for the two nations . The Assembly would spend a quarter of its full sessions on the subject of church government . The majority of the Assembly members supported presbyterian polity , or church government by elected assemblies of lay and clerical representatives , though many were not dogmatically committed to it . Several members of this group , numbering about twenty and including William Twisse , favoured a primitive episcopacy , which would include elements of presbyterianism and a reduced role for bishops .

The composition of the main facade , with its dominant drawn - out and elevated projection and the two symmetrical lower lateral parts , reflects the internal division into three naves . At ground - floor level , the front was distinguished by the three - arch entrance and bifora , whereas the first - floor level had a high triforium with an elevated arch and the quadrifoliate rosettes on the staircases .
After Applewhite 's release , he and Nettles resolved to contact extraterrestrials and they sought like - minded followers . They published advertisements for meetings , where they recruited disciples , whom they called crew . At the events , they purported to represent beings from another planet , the Next Level , who sought participants for an experiment . They claimed that those who agreed to take part in the experiment would be brought to a higher evolutionary level . He and Nettles referred to themselves as Guinea and Pig . Applewhite described his role as a lab instructor and served as the primary speaker , while Nettles , occasionally interjected clarifying remarks or corrections . The two seldom personally spoke with attendees , only taking phone numbers with which they could contact them . They initially named their organization the Anonymous Sexaholics Celibate Church , but it soon became known as the Human Individual Metamorphosis .
On 2 September 2005 , Fowler released a book called Fowler : My Autobiography , about his time as a footballer and the issues surrounding him . Since his transfer to Liverpool he has updated it and included a section about his return to Anfield . Excerpts published in newspapers included criticism of the England management .
Temnospondyls and other early tetrapods have rounded otic notches in the back of the skull that project into the cheek region . In life , the otic notch would have been covered by a membrane called the tympanum , which is seen as a disk - like area in living frogs . The tympanum is involved in hearing , and is similar to the ear drum of more advanced tetrapods . It was traditionally thought that the tympanum developed very early in tetrapod evolution as a hearing organ and progressed to form the ear drum of amniotes . Thus , temnospondyls possessed a hearing system supposedly ancestral to that of living amphibians and reptiles .
After receiving a federal land grant of about 2 , 000 acres 810 ha , Richard McLemore , the first settler of Meridian , began offering free land to newcomers to attract more settlers to the region and develop the area . Most of McLemore 's land was bought in 1853 by Lewis A. Ragsdale , a lawyer from Alabama . John T. Ball , a merchant from Kemper County , bought the remaining 80 acres 0 . 32 km2 . Ragsdale and Ball , now known as the founders of the city , began laying out lots for new development on their respective land sections .

The Languedoc - Roussillon region shares many terrain and climate characteristics with the neighboring regions of Southern Rhone and Provence . The region stretches 150 miles 240 km from the Banyuls AOC at the Spanish border and Pyrenees in the west , along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea to the Rhone River and Provence in the east . The northern boundaries of the region sit on the Massif Central with the C vennes mountain ranges and valleys dominating the area . Many vineyards are located along the H rault River .
Modern writers often think of Black 's role in more dynamic terms than merely trying to equalize . Rowson writes that the idea of Black trying to ' equalize ' is questionable . I think it has limited application to a few openings , rather than being an opening prescription for Black in general . Evans wrote that after one of his games against Fischer , Fischer confided his ' secret ' to me : unlike other masters , he sought to win with the Black pieces from the start . The revelation that Black has dynamic chances and need not be satisfied with mere equality was the turning point in his career , he said . Likewise , Watson surmised that Kasparov , when playing Black , bypasses the question of whether White has an opening advantage by thinking in terms of the concrete nature of the dynamic imbalance on the board , and seeking to seize the initiative whenever possible . Watson observes that energetic opening play by Black may ... lead to a position so complex and unclear that to speak of equality is meaningless . Sometimes we say ' dynamically balanced ' instead of ' equal ' to express the view that either player is as likely as the other to emerge from complications with an advantage . This style of opening play has become prevalent in modern chess , with World Champions Fischer and Kasparov as its most visible practitioners . 
During the same time frame as the Hitchcock rumors , goaltender Curtis Sanford returned from his groin injury on November 13 . He made his first start of the season against the Boston Bruins , losing 2 1 in a shootout . Sanford continued his strong play , posting a 3 1 2 record , 1 . 38 goals against average and .947 save percentage over his next six games . Sanford started 12 consecutive games before Steve Mason made his next start . The number of starts might not have been as numerous , but prior to the November 23 game , Mason was hit in the head by a shot from Rick Nash during pre - game warm - ups and suffered a concussion . Mason returned from his concussion after two games , making a start against the Vancouver Canucks . Mason allowed only one goal in the game despite suffering from cramping in the third period , temporarily being replaced by Sanford for just over three minutes . Columbus won the game 2 1 in a shootout , breaking a nine - game losing streak to the Canucks . After the game , Arniel stated that Sanford was still seen as the team 's number one goaltender . However , Mason started four of the next six games with the Blue Jackets going 0 5 1 during that stretch .
Nosek 's other friend Ond ej Vlach testified that Nosek 's fall happened in a break between the end of concert and the encore . Nosek climbed the stage together with another fan as the band members were leaving to go backstage . According to him , Blythe ran into the two fans and pushed them both off . While the other fan was caught by a couple of fans remaining under the stage , Nosek fell directly on the ground . According to Vlach , there were fewer fans in front of the stage due to the break . Vlach further testified that after the fall , Nosek went to sit on a bench , where he was fetched a water bottle . Nosek began vomiting about half an hour after the fall and as his friends realized that he had a bulge at the back of his head , they called an ambulance for fear he might have a concussion . Vlach said that he understood Blythe 's gesture in the break as an invitation to the stage .
In the 1870s , John Marius Wilson described Oldham as consisting of :

In each of their following two matches , at home against Hampshire and away to Worcestershire , Somerset batted first and then enforced the follow - on after bowling their opponents out cheaply . In each their opponents managed to avoid defeat , and both matches resulted in draws . During the Worcestershire match , Langer 's first innings 107 took him past Sir Donald Bradman 's total of 28 , 067 first - class runs to become the highest - scoring Australian batsman . Successive draws against Nottinghamshire , Warwickshire , Sussex and Hampshire meant that Somerset travelled to Durham requiring a victory to maintain any realistic hopes of claiming the County Championship title . No play was possible on the third and fourth days , and the match resulted in another draw , leaving Somerset with only a slim mathematical chance of the title . Another draw , against Lancashire , while Durham beat Nottinghamshire , meant that Durham clinched the title . Somerset drew with Worcestershire their ninth draw in a row in the competition , and finished third in the first division .
 Big Boy aka I 'm A Big Boy Now was the first single ever recorded by the Jackson 5 , which was released by Steeltown Records in January 1968 . The group played instruments on many of their Steeltown compositions , including Big Boy . The song was neither a critical nor commercial success , but the Jackson family were delighted with the outcome nonetheless .
During the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos , the region of the Metro Manila was created as an integrated unit with the enactment of Presidential Decree No. 824 on November 7 , 1975 . The area encompassed four cities and thirteen adjoining towns , as a separate regional unit of government . On the 405th anniversary of the city 's foundation on June 24 , 1976 , Manila was reinstated by Marcos as the capital of the Philippines for its historical significance as the seat of government since the Spanish Period . Presidential Decree No. 940 states that Manila has always been to the Filipino people and in the eyes of the world , the premier city of the Philippines being the center of trade , commerce , education and culture .
Serving with the Eighth Army , Wheeler was present in North Africa when the Axis armies pushed the Allies back to El Alamein . He was also part of the Allied counter - push , taking part in the Second Battle of El Alamein and the advance on Axis - held Tripoli . On the way he became concerned that the archaeological sites of North Africa were being threatened both by the fighting and the occupying forces . After the British secured control of Libya , Wheeler visited Tripoli and Leptis Magna , where he found that Roman remains had been damaged and vandalised by British troops ; he brought about reforms to prevent this , lecturing to the troops on the importance of preserving archaeology , making many monuments out - of - bounds , and ensuring that the Royal Air Force changed its plans to construct a radar station in the midst of a Roman settlement . Aware that the British were planning to invade and occupy the Italian island of Sicily , he insisted that measures be introduced to preserve the historic and archaeological monuments on the island .
 Moment of Surrender was written by U2 and No Line on the Horizon producers co - writers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois during a two - week recording session in Fez , Morocco between May and June 2007 . The song was developed within a few hours , and then recorded in a single take in a riad of the hotel Riad El Yacout . Eno began by creating a percussion loop of a rolling hand drum so that the band would have something to improvise along with when they joined him for songwriting and recording . However , Eno had not arranged the loop properly and the result was a strange , uneven beat that he compared to a wheeled carriage that had one of the wheels a bit cracked or the way a camel moves . Although Eno was trying to fix the loop , drummer Larry Mullen , Jr. began playing along to it . Eno then asked guitarist the Edge to play some chords . After a quick discussion about the chord changes and the meter in which they decided to have a funny layout that was not based on eighths or sixteenths , the six of them improvised the entirety of the piece .
The crusaders laid siege to Damietta , on the Nile , in May 1217 . Although they seized a strategically - important tower on a nearby island on 24 August , Al - Kamil who had succeeded Al - Adil I in Egypt controlled traffic on the Nile . In September , reinforcements commanded by Pope Honorius III 's legate Cardinal Pelagius who considered himself the crusade 's supreme commander arrived from Italy .
Within two months , however , the limit of the operational area was extended past the Mekong , and U.S. tactical aircraft were soon directly supporting Cambodian forces in the field . These missions were officially denied by the U.S. and false coordinates were given in official reports to hide their existence . Defense Department records indicated that out of more than 8 , 000 combat sorties flown in Cambodia between July 1970 and February 1971 , approximately 40 percent were flown outside the authorized Freedom Deal boundary .
An expert system is a program that answers questions or solves problems about a specific domain of knowledge , using logical rules that are derived from the knowledge of experts . The earliest examples were developed by Edward Feigenbaum and his students . Dendral , begun in 1965 , identified compounds from spectrometer readings . MYCIN , developed in 1972 , diagnosed infectious blood diseases . They demonstrated the feasibility of the approach .
Scientologists in Germany face specific political and economic restrictions . They are barred from membership in some major political parties , and businesses and other employers use so - called sect filters to expose a prospective business partner 's or employee 's association with the organization . German federal and state interior ministers started a process aimed at banning Scientology in late 2007 , but abandoned the initiative a year later , finding insufficient legal grounds . Despite this , polls suggest that most Germans favor banning Scientology altogether .
The buildings in the northern part of the mound indicative urbanization , with people of different ethnic groups Indian and non - Indian but it has not been possible to date them in view of the limited depth of excavations .
Howard Blake recalls : I went to a viewing and saw that the film was very profound , with a serious anti - war theme , but a certain amount of ' found ' choral music had already been laid in by the editors ... I explained that I loved the film and I thought the choral orchestral music worked brilliantly but it was very big and rich and I felt a score would have to emerge from it and be very pure and expressive and quite small and that I could only hear this in my head as done by strings only . Blake decided to compose his score to match the key of the Schubert Mass , in order for the music to continue seamlessly . However , during the recording session with his orchestra , the Sinfonia of London , he found that the Schubert piece was running slow and therefore flat , and he had to ask the players to tune flat to match his intended key .
Irish writer Garth Ennis then took over the title in 1991 , again from 2000 AD , where he had been working on Judge Dredd . He proceeded to write the longest run for any writer on the title . His take on the title was more personal than Jamie Delano 's , with John 's relationships coming to the fore . It also had a strong religious theme , with John 's dealings with the First of the Fallen , and some storylines , such as the relationship between an angel , Tali , and a succubus demon , Ellie , would go on to be used again as a major plot device in Preacher , one of his most popular works . He also references the music of The Pogues and the poetry of Brendan Behan , both of these being relevant to Ennis ' Irish heritage .
In 2012 , Fey made her rapping debut on the Childish Gambino Donald Glover mixtape Royalty . Glover is a former writer on 30 Rock , on which he worked with Fey . Fey was also featured as herself in the iCarly episode iShock America .
Boise National Forest 's 2010 forest plan recognizes that fire and other disturbances play important roles in maintaining the character and function of ecosystems . However , previous management strategies as recently as the 1990 forest plan treated fire as an undesirable process , and the Organic Act of 1897 explicitly stated that forests were to be protected from destruction by fire . In historic conditions fires naturally occurred on the landscape ; the suppression of fires allowed dead trees to accumulate in excess of historic levels and land cover types to change , such as a shift to higher shrub and tree densities . An estimated 14 percent of the land in Boise National Forest has been affected by fires since the early 1990s , and about 10 percent of the land capable of timber production was burned so severely that land cover shifted from forest to grass and shrubland as of 2010 .

The Dashashwamedh Ghat is the main and probably the oldest ghat of Varanasi located on the Ganges , close to the Kashi Vishwanath Temple . It is believed that Brahma created this ghat to welcome Shiva and sacrificed ten horses during the Dasa - Ashwamedha yajna performed there . Above and adjacent to this ghat , there are also temples dedicated to Sulatankesvara , Brahmesvara , Varahesvara , Abhaya Vinayaka , Ganga the Ganges , and Bandi Devi , which are all important pilgrimage sites . A group of priests perform Agni Pooja Sanskrit : Worship of Fire daily in the evening at this ghat as a dedication to Shiva , Ganga , Surya Sun , Agni Fire , and the entire universe . Special aartis are held on Tuesdays and on religious festivals .
Khoo was born in 1956 in the Penang state of Malaysia . He received his formal education at St. Xavier 's Institution before leaving for Singapore in 1974 , to continue his pre - university education at St. Joseph 's Institution . After completing his studies in 1978 , he worked as a journalist with The Star in Kuala Lumpur until 1980 when he joined Malaysia 's largest sugar refinery , Malayan Sugar Manufacturing Company Berhad , as a personnel manager .
British ships did not participate in any major wars in the ironclad period . The Royal Navy 's ironclads only saw action as part of colonial battles or one - sided engagements like the bombardment of Alexandria in 1882 . Defending British interests against Ahmed ' Urabi 's Egyptian revolt , a British fleet opened fire on the fortifications around the port of Alexandria . A mixture of centre - battery and turret ships bombarded Egyptian positions for most of a day , forcing the Egyptians to retreat ; return fire from Egyptian guns was heavy at first , but inflicted little damage , killing only five British sailors . Few Egyptian guns were actually dismounted , on the other hand , and the fortifications themselves were typically left intact . Had the Egyptians actually utilised the heavy mortars that were at their disposal , they might have quickly turned the tide , for the attacking British ironclads found it easy for accuracy 's sake to simply anchor whilst firing perfect targets for high - angle fire upon their thinly armoured topdecks .
Hu 's work was known outside his local area . Zhou Lianggong , a poet who lived in Nanjing around the same time as Hu and was a noted art connoisseur , stated in his Biography of Seal - Carvers Yinren Zhuan , that Hu creates miniature stone carvings with ancient seal inscriptions for travellers to fight over and treasure , implying that his carvings were popular with visitors and travellers passing through Nanjing .

In the sentencing phase of the trial , Abu - Jamal read to the jury from a prepared statement . He was then cross - examined about issues relevant to the assessment of his character by Joseph McGill , the prosecuting attorney .
In his career , Goffman worked at the :
Another Side of Bob Dylan , recorded on a single evening in June 1964 , had a lighter mood . The humorous Dylan reemerged on I Shall Be Free No. 10 and Motorpsycho Nightmare . Spanish Harlem Incident and To Ramona are passionate love songs , while Black Crow Blues and I Don 't Believe You She Acts Like We Never Have Met suggest the rock and roll soon to dominate Dylan 's music . It Ain 't Me Babe , on the surface a song about spurned love , has been described as a rejection of the role of political spokesman thrust upon him . His newest direction was signaled by two lengthy songs : the impressionistic Chimes of Freedom , which sets social commentary against a metaphorical landscape in a style characterized by Allen Ginsberg as chains of flashing images , and My Back Pages , which attacks the simplistic and arch seriousness of his own earlier topical songs and seems to predict the backlash he was about to encounter from his former champions as he took a new direction .
According to an article by the Daily Mail , the number of stay - at - home dads in 2007 had increased by 83 percent since 1993 . According to the same paper , in 2007 , recent figures from the Office for National Statistics showed more than 200 , 000 fathers chose to stay at home and be the primary caregiver for their children .
At the time of Daniel Faulkner 's murder , Abu - Jamal was working as a taxicab driver in Philadelphia two nights a week to supplement his income . He had been working part - time as a reporter for WDAS , then an African - American - oriented and minority - owned radio station .
The dated monuments at Tonin span the period from AD 495 to 909 , covering most of the Classic Period .
There were two main design alternatives to the broadside . In one design , the guns were placed in an armoured casemate amidships : this arrangement was called the ' box - battery ' or ' centre - battery ' . In the other , the guns could be placed on a rotating platform to give them a broad field of fire ; when fully armored , this arrangement was called a turret and when partially armored or unarmored , a barbette .

Contrary to the view here popularized by Cassius Dio , however , Nerva had in fact little choice with regard to his successor . Faced with a major crisis , he desperately needed the support of a man who could restore his damaged reputation . The only candidate with sufficient military experience , consular ancestry , and connections was Trajan . Likewise , Edward Gibbon 's assertion that Nerva hereby established a tradition of succession through adoption among the Five Good Emperors has found little support among modern historians .
The head puppet sculptor was Christine Glanville , who also served as the lead puppeteer . Glanville 's four - person team built the 13 members of the main cast in six months at a cost of between 250 and 300 per puppet approximately 4 , 569 and 5 , 483 today . Since pairs of episodes were being filmed simultaneously on separate stages , the characters needed to be sculpted in duplicate . Facial expressions were diversified by means of replaceable heads : as well as a head with a neutral expression , each main character was given a smiler , a frowner and a blinker . The finished puppets were approximately 22 inches 56 cm tall , or 1 3 adult human height .
The Newcastle Herald 's James Joyce said he was shocked when he first saw the episode : Who are the Americans trying to kid here ? I agree Australia has its faults , as does any other country . But laughing in our face about it , then mocking our heritage was definitely not called for . It embarrassed and degraded our country as well as making us look like total idiots . Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , the authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , advised that the episode is best if watched with Australians who will be , perhaps understandably , aggrieved at their portrayal . After the attack on the French , this is a vicious , unkind , offensive and wonderfully amusing slaughter of Australian culture by the makers of The Simpsons .
Another major issue is the amount of radiation to which a space probe is subjected , due to the harsh charged - particle environment around Jupiter for a detailed explanation see Magnetosphere of Jupiter . For example , when Pioneer 11 made its closest approach to the planet , the level of radiation was ten times more powerful than Pioneer 's designers had predicted , leading to fears that the probes would not survive . With a few minor glitches , the probe managed to pass through the radiation belts , but it lost most of the images of the moon Io , as the radiation had caused Pioneer 's imaging photo polarimeter to receive false commands . The subsequent and far more technologically advanced Voyager spacecraft had to be redesigned to cope with the radiation levels . Over the eight years the Galileo spacecraft orbited the planet , the probe 's radiation dose far exceeded its design specifications , and its systems failed on several occasions . The spacecraft 's gyroscopes often exhibited increased errors , and electrical arcs sometimes occurred between its rotating and non - rotating parts , causing it to enter safe mode , which led to total loss of the data from the 16th , 18th and 33rd orbits . The radiation also caused phase shifts in Galileo 's ultra - stable quartz oscillator .
King Edward fell ill in early 1553 . He drew up a document , My Devise for the Succession , whose final version of June 1553 was to settle the Crown on his Protestant cousin Lady Jane Grey , overturning the claims of his half - sisters Mary and Elizabeth . Jane Grey was the daughter of Frances Grey , Duchess of Suffolk , a niece of Henry VIII by his younger sister Mary . On 25 May 1553 three matrimonial alliances were celebrated at Durham Place , the Dudleys ' London town mansion . Two of their younger children were concerned : Guildford , aged about 17 , married Lady Jane Grey , while Katherine , who was between eight and ten years old , was promised to the Earl of Huntingdon 's heir , Henry Hastings . A few months later these matches came to be seen as proof of a conspiracy by the Duke of Northumberland to bring his family to the throne . At the time the marriages took place , however , their dynastical implications were not considered significant by even the most suspicious of observers , the Imperial ambassador Jehan de Scheyfye . Modern historians have considered them either as part of a plot , or as routine actions of dynastic politics , in the words of David Loades . The initiative for the matches had probably come from the Marchioness of Northampton .
A nestling begins to give the ' chip ' call soon after it emerges from the egg , and it calls frequently for the first two thirds of the nestling period and constantly for the last third . The call does not vary in the presence of an adult at the nest , so it seems likely that the call is not directed at the adult bird . The nestling becomes silent when an adult gives an alarm call , and makes a squealing sound when the adult delivers food . The begging call of a fledgling is similar to the call of the nestling , but significantly louder and covering a greater frequency range which may make it more directional . The rate of calling , on average , is 85 to 100 calls in a minute , and in open scrub the call can be heard up to a kilometre away . Subsong , a juvenile vocalization comprising elements of various calls , begins to be uttered when the fledgling is around thirty days old .
The plain maskray or brown stingray Neotrygon annotata is a species of stingray in the family Dasyatidae . It is found in shallow , soft - bottomed habitats off northern Australia . Reaching 24 cm 9 . 4 in in width , this species has a diamond - shaped , grayish green pectoral fin disc . Its short , whip - like tail has alternating black and white bands and fin folds above and below . There are short rows of thorns on the back and the base of the tail , but otherwise the skin is smooth . While this species possesses the dark mask - like pattern across its eyes common to its genus , it is not ornately patterned like other maskrays .
Olivia admits to Walter how she found the address and learns that her brain still contains some of John 's memories . Wishing to discover what else John knew and prevent any further visions from occurring , Olivia insists on returning to Walter s sensory deprivation tank . Inside the tank , Olivia sees a memory of John in a restaurant . Despite Walter 's vehement protest that it is impossible , Olivia is convinced that John Scott saw her . Afterwards , she sees John meeting with Mark and two other unidentified men . After Mark and another man leave , John kills the other man . Olivia believes the group were looking to sell the compound as a street drug , and is able to track down the other man , George Morales Yul Vazquez . Once apprehended , he denies killing Mark and demands immunity and protection from Massive Dynamic , who he believes was responsible for Mark 's death as well as other recent fringe events . Olivia confronts Nina Sharp Blair Brown about her suspicions , but George is murdered before he can be of further help to them . Later that night , Olivia gets another email from John Scott simply saying , I SAW YOU . IN THE RESTAURANT . 
Gilbert had chosen Tetsur Tamba after working with him in The 7th Dawn . A number of actual martial arts experts were hired as the ninjas . The two Japanese female parts proved difficult to cast , due to most of the actresses tested having limited English . Akiko Wakabayashi and Mie Hama were eventually chosen and started taking English classes in the UK . Hama , initially cast in the role of Tanaka 's assistant , had difficulty with the language , so the producers switched her role with Wakabayashi , who had been cast as Kissy , a part with significantly less dialogue . Wakabayashi only requested that her character name , Suki , be changed to Aki .
With the advent of challenges to phlogiston theory it was recognized that antimony is an element forming sulfides , oxides , and other compounds , as is the case with other metals .
Alkan 's attachment to the music of his predecessors is demonstrated throughout his career , from his arrangements for keyboard of Beethoven 's Seventh Symphony 1838 , and of the minuet of Mozart 's 40th Symphony 1844 , through the sets Souvenirs des concerts du Conservatoire 1847 and 1861 and the set Souvenirs de musique de chambre 1862 , which include transcriptions of music by Mozart , Beethoven , J. S. Bach , Haydn , Gluck , and others . In this context should be mentioned Alkan 's extensive cadenza for Beethoven 's 3rd Piano Concerto 1860 , which includes quotes from the finale of Beethoven 's 5th Symphony . Alkan 's transcriptions , together with original music of Bach , Beethoven , Handel , Mendelssohn , Couperin and Rameau , were frequently played during the series of Petits Concerts given by Alkan at Erard .
Kusanagi wakes up in a child - sized cyborg body in Batou 's safehouse . Batou explains that her original body was destroyed in the fight ; he recovered her head and attached it to the new body . Kusanagi acknowledges she is now neither herself nor the Puppet Master , but a combination of both . Batou says he will always be there for her . She leaves the house and gazes out over the city .
Weather conditions often change rapidly , and afternoon thunderstorms are common in the summertime ; hailstorms and snow are possible year - round . An electrical storm on the mountain 's summit was considered remarkable enough to be reported in the July 1894 issue of Science .
The earliest study has Bertin standing and leaning on a table in an almost Napoleonic pose . His hard , level stare is already established , but the focus seems to be on his groin rather than his face . It is obvious that Ingres struggled with the sketch ; the head is on a square of attached paper which must have replaced an earlier cut - out version , and other areas have been rubbed over and heavily reworked . The next extant drawing shows Bertin seated , but the chair is missing . The last extant sketch is the closest to the eventual painting , with a chair , though his bulk has not yet been filled out .
Homarus gammarus is susceptible to the disease gaffkaemia , caused by the bacterium Aerococcus viridans . Although it is frequently found in American lobsters , the disease has only been seen in captive H. gammarus , where prior occupation of the tanks by H. americanus could not be ruled out .
Another conflict that could have involved mar and the military forces of Dublin was Gruffudd 's final defeat of Hywel ab Edwin , King of Deheubarth died 1044 . According to Brut y Tywysogion and the B version of Annales Cambri this last stand of Hywel took place at the mouth of the River Tywi perhaps in the vicinity of Carmarthen and included Vikings from Ireland who supported Hywel 's cause . It is apparent that Gruffudd 's adversaries generally utilised foreign military support from Ireland 's Viking enclaves . Certainly , the Book of Llandaff declares that Gruffudd struggled against English , Irish , and Vikings during his career .
Reviewers also noted the environmental theme in the book . Kirkus Reviews found that With the impending threat of global warning as an ominous backdrop , teens from very different worlds find they have much in common . In the novel , Peter finds an underground civilization beneath Greenland that is sinking as a result of global warming . Burns felt that First Light is a great discussion starter of issues ranging from global warming to shunning and building a new society . VOYA recognized the global warming theme and also classified First Light as a coming - of - age tale .
German public discourse does not regard Scientology as a religion , but generally characterizes it as a Sekte cult or sect , or as an exploitative profit - making venture preying on vulnerable minds . Public concerns about the potential dangers posed by cults date back to the early 1970s , when widespread debate took place about youth religions such as the Unification Church , ISKCON , Children of God , and the Divine Light Mission . The most prominent critics of these new religious movements were the sect commissioners Sektenbeauftragte of Germany 's Protestant Churches , who also actively promoted the establishment of private initiatives of parents and concerned persons . Aktion Bildungsinformation Educational Information Campaign became an important organization dedicated to opposing Scientology ; taking an activist stance , it warned people not to get involved with Scientology , filed successful lawsuits against the Church of Scientology over its proselytizing in public places , and published an influential book , The Sect of Scientology and its Front Organizations . In 1981 , the organization 's founder , Ingo Heinemann , became the director of Aktion f r geistige und psychische Freiheit Campaign for Intellectual and Psychic Freedom , Germany 's most prominent anti - cult organization . Warnings from sect experts about the influence of new religious movements gained media attention which put political pressure on the government to deal with the situation ; as the movements were not doing anything illegal , the government resorted to issuing a range of leaflets and public statements giving general warnings about religious sects , the earliest of these publications appearing in 1979 .

Columbus started March with a 2 0 shutout against the Colorado Avalanche . They proceeded to win their next game against the Phoenix Coyotes 5 2 , which marked the first time that the Blue Jackets posted back - to - back regulation victories during the season . Columbus again defeated the Coyotes three days later to earn their first three - game win streak of the season . They extended the streak to four with a win over the Los Angeles Kings before it came to an end with a 4 1 loss to the St. Louis Blues . It was the only four - game win streak of the season for the Blue Jackets . They immediately matched their four - game win streak with a four - game losing streak and with ten games remaining , the Blue Jackets were the first team eliminated from playoff contention . Shortly after being eliminated , they were defeated by the Edmonton Oilers 6 3 ; the loss clinched last place in the NHL for Columbus . It was the first time in franchise history the Blue Jackets finished in 30th place .
Barrow then bought the Paterson Silk Weavers of the Class - A Atlantic League , managing them for the rest of the 1896 season . Barrow discovered Honus Wagner throwing lumps of coal at a railroad station in Pennsylvania , and signed him to his first professional contract . Barrow sold Wagner to the Louisville Colonels of the National League NL for 2 , 100 the next year 59 , 732 in current dollar terms . With poor attendance , Barrow brought in professional boxers as a draw : he had James J. Corbett play first base while John L. Sullivan and James J. Jeffries umpired . He also hired Lizzie Arlington , the first woman in professional baseball , to pitch a few innings a game .
Entering the 2010 season , the Crimson Tide was ranked No. 1 in the AP and Coaches ' Preseason Polls . The No. 1 preseason ranking was the first for Alabama since the 1978 season . In week six , Alabama dropped to the No. 8 ranking in both the AP and Coaches ' Poll following their loss to South Carolina . The Tide rebounded in the rankings though week nine , rising to No. 5 before dropping to No. 11 in the AP and No. 12 in the Coaches ' Poll following their loss at LSU . After their loss to Auburn , Alabama dropped to No. 15 in the AP , No. 18 in the Coaches ' Poll and No. 16 in the final BCS standings . Following the victory over Michigan State in the Capital One Bowl , Alabama finished No. 10 in the final AP , No. 11 in the final Coaches ' Polls .
Aerobatic competitions take place for both powered aircraft and gliders , with up to 30 events each year in the UK and Ireland . Starting at the Beginner level , pilots can move up to Standard powered aircraft or Sports glider levels , and then on to Intermediate , Advanced , and finally Unlimited classes . Each step up requires a wider repertoire of aerobatic figures and progressively more performance from the aircraft . National championships are awarded annually at Standard Sports , Intermediate , Advanced powered aircraft only , and Unlimited levels , and pilots who have reached Advanced and Unlimited levels are eligible for selection to represent the UK in international competition .
During the mid - twenties Walpole produced two of his best - known novels in the macabre vein that he drew on from time to time , exploring the fascination of fear and cruelty . The Old Ladies 1924 is a study of a timid elderly spinster exploited and eventually frightened to death by a predatory widow . Portrait of a Man with Red Hair 1925 depicts the malign influence of a manipulative , insane father on his family and others . Walpole described it to his fellow author Frank Swinnerton as a simple shocker which it has amused me like anything to write , and won 't bore you to read .

Most critics found the game to be a solid yet conventional action - platformer that successfully adheres to the classic Mega Man formula .

The Ottoman Turkish Empire entered the First World War on the side of the Central Powers on 31 October 1914 . The stalemate of trench warfare on the Western Front convinced the British Imperial War Cabinet that an attack on the Central Powers elsewhere , particularly Turkey , could be the best way of winning the war . From February 1915 this took the form of naval operations aimed at forcing a passage through the Dardanelles , but after several setbacks it was decided that a land campaign was also necessary . To that end , the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force was formed under the command of General Ian Hamilton . Three amphibious landings were planned to secure the Gallipoli Peninsula , which would allow the navy to attack the Turkish capital Constantinople , in the hope that would convince the Turks to ask for an armistice .

In his decade in charge of the National , Olivier acted in thirteen plays and directed eight . Several of the roles he played were minor characters , including a crazed butler in Feydeau 's A Flea in Her Ear and a pompous solicitor in Maugham 's Home and Beauty ; the vulgar soldier Captain Brazen in Farquhar 's 1706 comedy The Recruiting Officer was a larger role but not the leading one . Apart from his Astrov in the Uncle Vanya , familiar from Chichester , his first leading role for the National was Othello , directed by Dexter in 1964 . The production was a box - office success and was revived regularly over the next five seasons . His performance divided opinion . Most of the reviewers and theatrical colleagues praised it highly ; Franco Zeffirelli called it an anthology of everything that has been discovered about acting in the past three centuries . Dissenting voices included The Sunday Telegraph , which called it the kind of bad acting of which only a great actor is capable ... near the frontiers of self - parody ; the director Jonathan Miller thought it a condescending view of an Afro Caribbean person . The burden of playing this demanding part at the same time as managing the new company and planning for the move to the new theatre took its toll on Olivier . To add to his load , he felt obliged to take over as Solness in The Master Builder when the ailing Redgrave withdrew from the role in November 1964 . For the first time Olivier began to suffer from stage fright , which plagued him for several years . The National Theatre production of Othello was released as a film in 1965 , which earned four Academy Award nominations , including another for Best Actor for Olivier .
May 3 , 2006 , was the premiere of Dylan 's radio presenting career , hosting a weekly radio program , Theme Time Radio Hour , for XM Satellite Radio , with song selections revolving around a chosen theme . Dylan played classic and obscure records from the 1930s to the present day , including contemporary artists as diverse as Blur , Prince , L.L. Cool J and the Streets . The show was praised by fans and critics as great radio , as Dylan told stories and made eclectic references with his sardonic humor , while achieving a thematic beauty with his musical choices . In April 2009 , Dylan broadcast the 100th show in his radio series ; the theme was Goodbye and the final record played was Woody Guthrie 's So Long , It 's Been Good to Know Yuh . This has led to speculation that Dylan 's radio series may have ended .
Ronald Munro Ferguson has been quoted in 1912 as saying many things would have gone otherwise had Lady Rosebery lived . Her loss is today as great a calamity from every point of view as it was at the time of her death . 
Surrounding the base of the monument is a terrazzo floor embedded with a star map . The map depicts the Northern Hemisphere sky at the moment of President Roosevelt 's dedication of the dam . This is intended to help future astronomers , if necessary , calculate the exact date of dedication . The 30 - foot - high 9 . 1 m bronze figures , dubbed Winged Figures of the Republic , were each formed in a continuous pour . To put such large bronzes into place without marring the highly polished bronze surface , they were placed on ice and guided into position as the ice melted . Hansen 's bas - relief on the Nevada elevator tower depicts the benefits of the dam : flood control , navigation , irrigation , water storage , and power . The bas - relief on the Arizona elevator depicts , in his words , the visages of those Indian tribes who have inhabited mountains and plains from ages distant . 
The species was first described by entomologist Nicholas Marcellus Hentz in 1845 in the Boston Journal of Natural History . Hentz named the species Attus sexpunctatus and described it as follows :
It has been suggested that an opportunity was lost on 5 August to encircle and capture the invading Austrian , German and Ottoman force when it was allowed to withdraw to Katia . The infantry 's difficulties regarding the supply of water and camel transport combined with their lack of desert training , together with Lawrence 's confusing orders for infantry in the 52nd Lowland Division to move south and east , stopped them from promptly advancing to cut off the retreating force in the early hours of the second day 's battle . General Lawrence was criticised for taking a grave and unnecessary risk by relying on just one entrenched infantry division and two light horse brigades to defend Romani . That the strong enemy attack on the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades during the first night 's battle pushed them so far back that the planned flanking attack by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade became almost a frontal attack . Lawrence was also faulted for remaining at his headquarters at Kantara , which was considered to be too far from the battlefield , and that this contributed to his loss of control of the battle during the first day , when the telephone line was cut and he was out of contact with Romani . Lawrence was also criticised for not going forward to supervise the execution of his orders on 5 August , when there was a failure to coordinate the movements of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade and the Mobile Column .
Arguably Eads vessels were some of the better ironclads of the Western Flotilla , but there were a number of other vessels that served valiantly with the fleet . All were of varying design , some more successful than others , and some were similar to standard riverboats but with armored side - mounted paddle wheels . All were armed with various smoothbore and some rifled guns . If nothing else the experience of the American Civil War and its wild variety of competing ironclad designs , some more successful or disastrous than others , confirmed the emerging trade - off or compromises required in applying the latest technological advances in iron armour manufacture , ship construction and gun design to name a few also going on in Europe . There was no such thing as a ' perfect ' ironclad which could be invincible in every possible encounter ; ship duels , standing up to forts , Brown Blue - water operations .

Apart from multiple made - for - television versions , The Importance of Being Earnest has been adapted for the English - language cinema at least three times , first in 1952 by Anthony Asquith who adapted the screenplay and directed it . Michael Denison Algernon , Michael Redgrave Jack , Edith Evans Lady Bracknell , Dorothy Tutin Cecily , Joan Greenwood Gwendolen , and Margaret Rutherford Miss Prism and Miles Malleson Canon Chasuble were among the cast . In 1992 Kurt Baker directed a version using an all - black cast with Daryl Keith Roach as Jack , Wren T. Brown as Algernon , Ann Weldon as Lady Bracknell , Lanei Chapman as Cecily , Chris Calloway as Gwendolen , CCH Pounder as Miss Prism , and Brock Peters as Doctor Chasuble , set in the United States . Oliver Parker , an English director who had previously adapted An Ideal Husband by Wilde , made the 2002 film ; it stars Colin Firth Jack , Rupert Everett Algy , Judi Dench Lady Bracknell , Reese Witherspoon Cecily , Frances O 'Connor Gwendolen , Anna Massey Miss Prism , and Tom Wilkinson Canon Chasuble . Parker 's adaptation includes the dunning solicitor Mr. Gribsby who pursues Jack to Hertfordshire present in Wilde 's original draft , but cut at the behest of the play 's first producer . Algernon too is pursued by a group of creditors in the opening scene .
Several proposals were made to prevent pad - play . At a meeting of representatives of the main county cricket clubs in 1888 , one representative expressed the opinion that a batsman who defended his wicket with his body instead of with his bat should be punished . The representatives supported a motion to alter the law to state that the batsman would be out if he stopped a ball that would have hit the wicket ; in contrast to the existing wording , this took no account of where the ball pitched relative to the wickets . Further proposals included one in which the intent of the batsman was taken into account , but no laws were changed and the MCC merely issued a condemnation of the practice of using pads for defence . This reduced pad - play for a short time , but when it increased again , a second pronouncement by the MCC had little effect .
Kershaw finished 2012 with a 14 9 record , a 2 . 53 ERA leading the league , 229 strikeouts , and 2272 3 innings pitched , coming second in both categories . He became the first pitcher to lead the league in ERA in consecutive seasons since Arizona 's Randy Johnson in 2001 02 . This was also marked his fourth year in a row with a sub - 3 . 00 ERA , making him the first to do this since Randy Johnson from 1999 2002 . He finished second for the NL Cy Young behind R. A. Dickey , receiving two first place votes .

Kieswetter 's performances in the 2009 season led to his inclusion in the England Performance Programme squad in November and December of that year , and he was part of the England Lions squad which toured the United Arab Emirates in early 2010 , along with Somerset team - mate Peter Trego . His full England debut came shortly after in Bangladesh . Additionally , two of Somerset 's young players , Jos Buttler and Calum Haggett played for England Under - 19s during the English winter .
In 1980 , the management of Braathens SAFE decided that it needed larger aircraft if the company was to stay competitive on charter flights . Larger aircraft could be put into service on the main services from Oslo , Gothenburg and Stockholm , while the 737s could be used to smaller destination and from other cities . On 25 February 1980 , the company announced that it had ordered two Boeing 767 - 200 planes , with an option for two addition craft . The cost of the two firm orders was about NOK 500 million . This would allow the aircraft to be used for both domestic scheduled flights and for charter , and was configured with 242 seats . This was less than charter - only airlines , for instance Britannia had their planes configured with 273 seats . Braathens SAFE 's planes were delivered on 23 March and in November 1984 . The following year showed increasing charter traffic , although it only made up 25 of the company 's revenue . The company had considered the smaller Boeing 757 , but did not have sufficient range . Also the Airbus A310 was close to being chosen .

In July 2006 , Bosi and his wife Claire announced that they were intending to sell Hibiscus and open a new restaurant closer to London , or in the capital itself . Hibiscus closed in Ludlow in April 2007 , with Bosi selling the site to fellow chef Alan Murchison for 247 , 500 , but retaining the Hibiscus name for himself . The restaurant was renamed Le Becasse sic , and underwent a 100 , 000 makeover before being re - opened under head chef Will Holland . In 2014 , Murchison 's company went into voluntary liquidation after running up debts of almost half a million pounds .
The nightingale 's song within the poem is connected to the art of music in a way that the urn in Ode on a Grecian Urn is connected to the art of sculpture . As such , the nightingale would represent an enchanting presence and , unlike the urn , is directly connected to nature . As natural music , the song is for beauty and lacks a message of truth . Keats follows Coleridge 's belief , as found in The Nightingale , in separating from the world by losing himself in the bird 's song . Although Keats favours a female nightingale over Coleridge 's masculine bird , both reject the traditional depiction of the nightingale as related to the tragedy of Philomela . Their songbird is a happy nightingale that lacks the melancholic feel of previous poetic depictions . The bird is only a voice within the poem , but it is a voice that compels the narrator to join with in and forget the sorrows of the world . However , there is tension in that the narrator holds Keats 's guilt regarding the death of Tom Keats , his brother . The song 's conclusion represents the result of trying to escape into the realm of fancy .
The sculpture rests atop a grey granite base that is 6 . 33 feet 1 . 93 m tall , 3 . 166 feet 0 . 965 m wide and 3 . 5 feet 1 . 1 m deep . The corners of the base have small leaf designed and has 2 feet 0 . 61 m by 2 . 66 feet 0 . 81 m bronze reliefs with arched tops on each side . The front relief states that it was erected in the memory of the citizens of East Providence who served in World War I from 1917 to 1918 , and lists the names of twenty three soldiers . The left relief depicts a marching infantry column of one man on horseback and four on foot , the right relief depicts four or five men loading a cannon and the rear relief depicts a nurse assisting two wounded soldiers .
The breeding season starts in May in Poland but further north in Scandinavia may not start until early July . The female fieldfare builds a cup - shaped nest with no attempt at concealment . The location is often in woodland but may be in a hedgerow , garden , among rocks , in a pile of logs , in a hut or on the ground . Fieldfares usually nest in close proximity to others of the same species . The adults will defend the nest aggressively and nesting gregariously may offer protection from predators . The nest is built of dried grasses and weeds with a few twigs and a little moss , with a lining of mud and an inner lining of fine grasses . There are usually five to six eggs in a clutch , but occasionally three , four , seven or eight eggs are laid . The eggs vary in size from 28 . 8 by 20 . 9 millimetres 1 . 13 in 0 . 82 in to 33 . 5 by 23 . 4 millimetres 1 . 32 in 0 . 92 in and are variable in colour . Many are pale blue speckled with fine brown dots and resemble those of the common blackbird . Others are bright blue , with or without larger red - brown splotches . Incubation starts before all the eggs are laid and lasts for thirteen to fourteen days . The female does all or most of the incubation . The chicks are altricial and both parents bring food to them . They are usually ready to leave the nest after fourteen to sixteen days and there may be two broods in the season , especially in the southern parts of the breeding range .
Dicey 's opinion that any action of governance by the monarch beyond statute is under the prerogative diverges from Blackstone 's that the prerogative simply covers those actions that no other person or body in the United Kingdom can undertake , such as the dissolution of Parliament . Case law exists to support both views . Blackstone s notion of the prerogative being the powers of an exclusive nature was favoured by Lord Parmoor in the De Keyser s Royal Hotel case of 1920 , but some difficulty with it was expressed by Lord Reid in the Burmah Oil case of 1965 . A clear distinction has not been necessary in the relevant cases , and the courts may never need to settle the question as few cases deal directly with the prerogative itself .
James Polehinke , the first officer , suffered serious injuries , including multiple broken bones , a collapsed lung , and severe bleeding . Lexington - Fayette and airport police officers pulled Polehinke out of the wreckage . Polehinke underwent surgery for his injuries , including an amputation of his left leg . Doctors later determined that Polehinke had suffered brain damage and has no memory of the crash or the events leading up to it . As of August 2007 , Polehinke was a wheelchair user . During the same month , Polehinke filed a lawsuit against the airport and the company that designed the runway and taxi lights . A January 2014 episode of Piers Morgan Live reported that Polehinke was paraplegic .
The most basic type of meetings are all - comers track meets , which are largely small , local , informal competitions that allow people of all ages and abilities to compete . As meetings become more organized they can gain official sanctioning by the local or national association for the sport .
In the end , the 1968 merger with the Chicago and North Western C NW sealed the Winston Tunnel 's fate . The Great Western 's main line through northern Illinois closely paralleled the North Western 's own line , but through less densely populated and less commercially active areas . The steep grades of the line and the obvious financial burden of the Winston Tunnel also played a role in the decision to completely abandon the Great Western 's trackage in the area . The C NW operated its last train through the tunnel in 1971 . Scrappers pulled up the tracks the following year . Upon abandonment , the C NW placed chain - link fences over each bore of the tunnel to keep squatters and other trespassers out . A 1973 attempt to turn the right - of - way through Jo Daviess County , including the Winston Tunnel , into a rail trail , failed when ownership of the land reverted to nearby property owners .
Unlike some other West Bank localities , unemployment is a minor issue in Jifna . However , the average income is low because of the unstable political situation in the Palestinian territories , Israeli checkpoints , the West Bank barrier and the 2006 freezing by Israel of funds to the Palestinian territories although the latter no longer applies to the West Bank .
In 1946 , the Labour government in Britain , its exchequer exhausted by the recently concluded World War II , realised that it had neither the mandate at home , the international support , nor the reliability of native forces for continuing to control an increasingly restless India . In February 1947 , Prime Minister Clement Attlee announced that the British government would grant full self - governance to British India by June 1948 at the latest .

Marge does not want to talk to anybody about her fear , and Lisa worries that Marge 's decision to keep her feelings bottled up will cause them to come out in other ways . When Marge begins to show signs of her lingering flight - related trauma by insisting the cat and the dog are living in sin , cooking giant feasts , and shingling the roof in the middle of the night , Lisa convinces Marge to undergo treatment with therapist Dr. Zweig . Homer , however , grows increasingly paranoid about Marge 's therapy , believing that Zweig will blame Marge 's trauma on him , and encourage her to leave him .
On the game 's next play , Chapman passed the ball deep , toward the end zone . Though the pass fell incomplete , a game official called a 15 - yard pass interference penalty against NC State . This moved the ball to the NC State 23 - yard line and forced Tech kicker Chris Kinzer to attempt a potentially game - winning 40 - yard field goal with four seconds remaining . Though NC State coach Dick Sheridan called a timeout in an attempt to ice Chris Kinzer , the kick sailed through the uprights and Virginia Tech won a 25 24 victory as time expired .

A 1985 government committee , led by State Secretary Per Arne Watle , recommended that more route be flown by both Braathens SAFE and SAS , and that additional airlines be allowed to start other routes . On 5 September 1985 , Braathens SAFE applied for the route Trondheim Bod Harstad Narvik Troms and Troms Longyearbyen . SAS had stated that it was fine with them if other airlines started flying international routes they did not , and on 17 October Braathens SAFE also applied for the routes Bergen Stavanger Paris , Bergen Stavanger Manchester , Oslo Stavanger Brussels and Trondheim Bergen Newcastle . The applications were rejected and it was agreed upon that SAS would retain all rights to fly internationally between Oslo , Bergen , Stavanger , Gothenburg , Stockholm , Copenhagen and rhus .

A major problem in sending space probes to Jupiter is that the planet has no solid surface on which to land , as there is a smooth transition between the planet 's atmosphere and its fluid interior . Any probes descending into the atmosphere are eventually crushed by the immense pressures within Jupiter .
Arguably the most successful of the Missouri Company expeditions was that of James MacKay and John Evans . The two set out along the Missouri , and established Fort Charles about 20 miles 32 km south of present - day Sioux City as a winter camp in 1795 . At the Mandan villages in North Dakota , they expelled several British traders , and while talking to the populace they pinpointed the location of the Yellowstone River , which was called Roche Jaune Yellow Rock by the French . Although MacKay and Evans failed to accomplish their original goal of reaching the Pacific , they did create the first accurate map of the upper Missouri River .
There are also indoor continental competitions in Europe European Athletics Indoor Championships and Asia Asian Indoor Athletics Championships . There has not been a consistent championships for all of North America , which may be in part due to the success of both the Central American and Caribbean Championships and the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships . Most countries have a national championship in track and field and , for athletes , these often play a role in gaining selection into major competitions . Some countries hold many track and field championships at high school and college - level , which help develop younger athletes . Some of these have gained significant exposure and prestige , such as the NCAA Track and Field Championship in the United States and the Jamaican High School Championships . However , the number and status of such competitions significantly vary from country to country .

The Phillies finished with the best record in MLB for the second year in a row . In the 2011 National League Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals , Hamels started Game 3 which resulted in a 3 - 2 win to give the Phillies a 2 - 1 series lead , however the Phillies would lose Games 4 and 5 to be eliminated .
The early Jain canons and teachings contained multitudes of references to anek ntav da and sy dv da in rudimentary form without giving it proper structure or establishing it as a separate doctrine . v t mbara text , Sutrakritanga contains references to Vibhagyav da , which , according to Hermann Jacobi , is the same as sy dv da and saptibha g . Bhagvatis tra mentions only three primary predications of the saptibha g naya . After Mah v ra , Kundakunda 1st century CE was the first author saint to expound on the doctrine of sy dv da and saptibha g and give it a proper structure in his famous works Pravacanas ra and Pancastikayas ra . Kundakunda also used nayas to discuss the essence of the self in Samayas ra . Proper classification of the nayas was provided by the philosopher monk , Um sv ti 2nd century CE in Tattv rthas tra . Samantabhadra 2nd century CE and Siddhasena Div kara 3rd century CE further fine - tuned Jain epistemology and logic by expounding on the concepts of anek ntav da in proper form and structure .
Melinda Newman of HitFix called the video undeniably steamy . Emily Hewett of the Metro wrote that the video featured flawless dance moves from Brown . Robbie Daw of Idolator noted that Brown makes things real sexy in the video , but was unsure if we should be turned on or utterly creeped out . Jessica Sager of PopCrush noted that Brown channels his R B side and added that he is a bit of a clumsy romantic . Jessica Sinclair of the Long Island Press described the video as a juicy new entertainment for Brown 's fans in anticipation of his new album . Jazmine Gray of Vibe magazine described the video as hot , heavy and really wet . Upon its release , the video went viral and received over one million views in its first day of release .
According to Catholic teaching , this commandment does not preclude the use of God 's name in taking solemn oaths administered by legitimate authority . However , lying under oath , invoking God 's name for magical purposes , or voicing words of hatred or defiance against God are considered sins of blasphemy .
At the same time , tension began to build between Mantell and Richard Owen , an ambitious scientist with much better funding and society connections in the turbulent worlds of Reform Act era British politics and science . Owen , a firm creationist , opposed the early versions of evolutionary science transmutationism then being debated and used what he would soon coin as dinosaurs as a weapon in this conflict . With the paper describing Dinosauria , he scaled down dinosaurs from lengths of over 61 metres 200 feet , determined that they were not simply giant lizards , and put forward that they were advanced and mammal - like , characteristics given to them by God ; according to the understanding of the time , they could not have been transmuted from reptiles to mammal - like creatures .
Yermolinsky also agrees with Alekhine 's criticism of 1.g3 e5 2.Nf3 , a reversed Alekhine 's Defense , in R ti Alekhine , Baden - Baden 1925 , writing that Alekhine understood the difference in opening philosophies for White and Black , and realized they just can 't be the same ! White is supposed to try for more than just obtaining a comfortable game in reversed colour opening set - ups , and , as the statistics show surprisingly for a lot of people , but not for me White doesn 't even score as well as Black does in the same positions with his extra tempo and all . Howard Staunton , generally considered to have been the strongest player in the world from 1843 to 1851 , made a similar point over 160 years ago , writing that Owen 's Defense 1.e4 b6 is playable for Black , but that 1.b3 is inferior to the more customary first moves , from its being essentially defensive . The current view is that Owen 's Defense is slightly better for White , while 1.b3 is playable but less likely to yield an opening advantage than 1.e4 or 1.d4.
The day after the explosion , Organisation Todt workers were assigned to clean up the debris and wreckage . On 30 March at 16 : 30 the torpedoes from MTB 74 , which were on a delayed fuse setting , exploded at the old entrance into the basin . This raised alarms among the Germans . The Organisation Todt workers ran away from the dock area . German guards , mistaking their khaki uniforms for British uniforms , opened fire , killing some of them . The Germans also thought that some Commandos were still hiding in the town , and made a street by street search , during which some townspeople were also killed .
Boise State came into the game averaging 42 . 75 points and 475 . 67 yards per game , the fourth and twelfth highest totals in college football . Senior quarterback Taylor Tharp led the offense by more than 3 , 000 yards and 28 touchdowns , headed into the 2007 Hawaii Bowl . On the ground , the Broncos were led by junior running back Ian Johnson , who had 17 touchdowns and 1 , 030 yards in the regular season . Wide receiver Jeremy Childs also was a potent threat on offense , averaging 87 . 08 receiving yards per game , and backup running back D.J. Harper rushed for 41 . 44 yards per game on average . Johnson and Childs both earned First Team All - WAC honors , and Tharp was named to Second Team All - WAC . Offensive tackle Ryan Clady was the team 's only All - American , and promised to do a good job protecting Taylor Tharp on the offensive line .
A .38 caliber Charter Arms revolver , belonging to Abu - Jamal , with five spent cartridges was retrieved beside him at the scene . He was wearing a shoulder holster , and Anthony Paul , the Supervisor of the Philadelphia Police Department 's firearms identification unit , testified at trial that the cartridge cases and rifling characteristics of the weapon were consistent with bullet fragments taken from Faulkner 's body . Tests to confirm that Abu - Jamal had handled and fired the weapon were not performed , as contact with arresting police and other surfaces at the scene could have compromised the forensic value of such tests .
Although most stories submitted to Super Science Stories were rejects from the better - paying markets such as Astounding Science Fiction , Pohl recalled in his memoirs that John W. Campbell , the editor of Astounding , would occasionally pass on a good story by a prolific author because he felt readers did not want to see the same authors in every issue . As a result , Pohl was able to print L. Sprague de Camp 's Genus Homo , in the March 1941 Super Science Stories , and Robert Heinlein 's Let There Be Light and Lost Legacy in the May 1940 and November 1941 issues : these were stories which , in Pohl 's opinion , would have looked good anywhere . Pohl also suggested that Campbell rejected some of Heinlein 's stories because they contained mild references to sex . A couple of readers did complain , with one disgusted letter writer commenting If you are going to continue to print such pseudosophisticated , pre - prep - school tripe as Let There Be Light , you should change the name of the mag to Naughty Future Funnies .
It should be borne in mind that the characteristics of the filter predicted by the image method are only accurate if the section is terminated with its image impedance . This is usually not true of the sections at either end , which are usually terminated with a fixed resistance . The further the section is from the end of the filter , the more accurate the prediction will become , since the effects of the terminating impedances are masked by the intervening sections .

Saprang had a public confrontation with former Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh regarding the 2006 Bangkok New Year 's Eve bombings after Chavalit accused him of incompetence . Saprang claimed that the evidence and intelligence information proves that the bombs were the dirty work of politicians who lost power and benefits . Bad soldiers loyal to bad politicians collaborated with them with the intention to topple this government . However , his claim was contradicted just an hour later by Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont .
The historian Ben Hughes commented on the novel : The Liberator 's British confidants , including Daniel O 'Leary , were amongst the closest figures to the general in this period . Nevertheless , they are ignored in the novel . Instead , M rquez uses the character of a fictional Colombian servant , Jos Palacios , as The Liberator 's final sounding board , thereby neatly sidestepping the more complex reality . In Hughes 's view modern South American literature has played a role in cleansing the national memory of British soldiers ' assistance to The Liberator .
The Ashland County Sports Hall of Fame inducted Richmond in their second class in 1996 . In 1998 , NASCAR named Richmond one of its 50 greatest drivers of all time . He was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 2002 . The Mansfield Motorsports Park ARCA Re Max Series race in 2009 was named the Tim Richmond Memorial ARCA Re Max 250 in honor of the area native . The race at Mansfield was co - promoted by Mattioli 's son Joseph Mattioli III .
The Norse held sway throughout the Hebrides from the 9th century until after the Treaty of Perth in 1266 . However , apart from placenames , little remains of their presence on Skye in the written or archaeological record . Apart from the name Skye itself , all pre - Norse placenames seem to have been obliterated by the Scandinavian settlers . Viking heritage is claimed by Clan MacLeod and Norse tradition is celebrated in the winter fire festival at Dunvegan , during which a replica Viking long boat is set alight .
The concept of positive prayer ... If you can imagine a world at peace , with no denominations of religion not without religion but without this my God - is - bigger - than - your - God thing then it can be true ... the World Church called me once and asked , Can we use the lyrics to ' Imagine ' and just change it to ' Imagine one religion ' ? That showed me they didn 't understand it at all . It would defeat the whole purpose of the song , the whole idea .
A more recent theory , with broad support among archaeologists , is that Celtic culture and language arrived in Ireland as a result of cultural diffusion . This theory proposes that the Celticisation of Ireland may have been the culmination of a long process of social and economic interaction between Ireland , Britain and adjacent parts of Continental Europe .
Looking Glass signed a multi - game publishing deal with Electronic Arts in May 1998 , and that company became the publisher of Flight Combat . The team undersold the game to Electronic Arts , and James Sterrett of the fansite Through the Looking Glass believed that the team gambled that it could get the game out the door faster than the budget actually called for . In March 1999 , the game was announced as the World War II - themed Flight Combat : Thunder Over Europe , directed by Hantzopoulos and scheduled for release in fall of that year . That May , the game was shown at the Electronic Arts booth at E3 . Computer Games Magazine 's Steve Udell wrote that the game would feature a new iteration of the Flight Unlimited terrain renderer , and IGN reported that one million square miles of terrain based on European landscapes would be available . Weather conditions such as snow and rain were planned . Udell wrote that Flight Combat 's flight physics were an updated version of those from recent Flight Unlimited games , with new material taken from operations manuals and flight tests . Plane models and textures were based on photographs , and many of the moving parts and flight control surfaces were modeled individually . Players were given the option to customize planes . Udell described a physics - based damage system that , according to the company , made it impossible to see the exact same kind of damage twice . Two campaigns the Battle of Britain and the Defence of the Reich were announced , with missions based on dogfights , air - to - ground combat and bombing runs . Looking Glass claimed that the game would feature moving tanks and ships duk ing it out on a dynamic battlefield as the player carried out missions . Aesthetically , IGN 's Tal Blevins noted that the game had a very distinct 40s charm , which was present from the briefings to the options screens .
The arrival of the Mongols did not initially upset the existing order at the borderlands as the Mongols were intent on finishing off the Song . For the next dozen years , they consolidated their hold over the newly conquered land , which not only provided them with a base from which to attack the Song from the rear but also was strategically located on the trade routes from China to Burma and India . The Mongols set up military garrisons , manned mostly by Turkic - speaking Muslims from Central Asia , in 37 circuits of the former Dali Kingdom .
Citizens in the south were opposed to a centralised government , and to the decrees of its rule , which resulted in rebellion . Prior to the revolution France had been divided into provinces with local governments . In 1790 the government , the National Constituent Assembly , reorganised France into administrative departments in order to rebalance the uneven distribution of French wealth , which had been subject to feudalism under the monarchical Ancien R gime .

Fort Abercrombie was built in 1858 on the Red River at what is now the border between Minnesota and North Dakota near modern McCauleyville . The fort had to be moved soon afterward because of flooding problems . It was created to spur settlement of the Red River Valley , protect steamboat traffic on the river , and protect wagon trains travelling to Montana .
He was known for his support of representative democracy and his populist style . For example , he would hold town halls and let constituents vote on motions to decide what he would do in Congress on their behalf . These meetings helped Bedell understand the problems of his constituents ; as a result , he backed issues that were important to his farming constituency , such as waterway usage fees and production constraints .

The plot of the episode is based on the story of Michael Fay , an American teenager who was caned in Singapore in 1994 for vandalizing cars . This episode perpetuated a popular myth that the Coriolis effect affects the motion of drains in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres . In reality , the Coriolis effect affects global weather patterns . The amount of water in a toilet or sink is much too small to be affected by it .
Donald Barthelme 's 1974 short story I bought a little city is about an unnamed man who invests his fortune in buying Galveston , only to sell it thereafter .
Before 1948 , Haifa 's Municipality was fairly unusual as it developed cooperation between the mixed Arab and Jewish community in the city , with representatives of both groups involved in the city 's management . Under mayor al - Haj , between 1920 and 1927 , the city council had six Arab and two Jewish representatives , with the city run as a mixed municipality with overall Arab control . Greater cooperation was introduced under Hasan Bey Shukri , who adopted a positive and conciliatory attitude toward the city 's Jews and gave them senior posts in the municipality . In 1940 , the first Jewish mayor , Shabtai Levy , was elected . Levy 's two deputies were Arab one Muslim , the other Christian , with the remainder of the council made up of four Jews and six Arabs .

Upon the release of It Won 't Be Soon Before Long , music critics commented on the original version of the song , which does not include guest vocals by Rihanna . Jerome Blakeney for BBC wrote that If I Never See Your Face Again , along with another It Won 't Be Soon Before Long track Makes Me Wonder , were monster weapons of mass - marketing aimed at the feet and riding on swathes of string - drenched , synth - crunching disco . A reviewer for IGN was complimentary of ' If I Never See Your Face Again ' , writing that it is hard to resist listening to the song . The reviewer also noted that Levine appeared to adopt a vocal style reminiscent of techniques employed by Justin Timberlake , writing Like Justin Timberlake it 's all about the high pitched tenor falsetto and some sinewy grooves . 
In 1924 , the Director of the National Museum of Wales , William Evans Hoyle , resigned amid ill health . Wheeler applied to take on the role of his replacement , providing supportive testimonials from Charles Reed Peers , Robert Bosanquet , and H. J. Fleure . Although he had no prior museum experience , he was successful in his application and was appointed Director . He then employed a close friend , Cyril Fox , to take on the vacated position of Keeper of Archaeology . Wheeler 's proposed reforms included extending the institution 's reach and influence throughout Wales by building affiliations with regional museums , and focusing on fundraising to finance the completion of the new museum premises . He obtained a 21 , 367 donation from the wealthy shipowner William Reardon Smith and appointed Smith to be the museum 's treasurer , and also travelled to Whitehall , London , where he successfully urged the British Treasury to provide further funding for the museum . As a result , construction on the museum 's new building was able to continue , and it was officially opened by King George V in 1927 .
The region was known for its wine . Since the 15th century the local inhabitants practiced viticulture and the wine producers formed St. Paul Vintners ' Guild in 1447 , the oldest such guild in the German - speaking world . Terraced vineyards extended up the sides of the Krems River until it became a mountain stream and terrain was unsuitable for cultivation . The Loiben plain supported both viticulture and agriculture . As the terrain became steeper , the vines grew in terraces built from the dark Urgestein , primordial rock . From D renstein to Krems the river makes its wide curve ; the mountains and the steeply terraced slopes prevent clear line - of - sight between the two towns .
By 1892 , Mogadishu was under the joint control of the Somali Sultanate of the Geledi and the Omani Sultanate of Zanzibar . The Geledi Sultans were at the height of their power . They dominated the southern ivory trade , and also held sway over the Jubba and Shebelle valleys in the hinterland . The Omani Sultans ' authority in Mogadishu , however , was largely nominal . When Imam Azzan bin Qais of Oman sought to build a fort in the city , he was thus obligated to request permission from Sultan Ahmed Yusuf of Geledi . This Fort of Garessa was eventually constructed in 1870 . The Sultan of Zanzibar later leased and then sold the infrastructure that he had built to the Italians , but not the land itself , which was Somali owned .

 By the end of 1984 , From Time Immemorial had ... received some two hundred favorable notices ... in the United States . The only ' false ' notes in this crescendoing chorus of praise were the Journal of Palestine Studies , which ran a highly critical review by Bill Farrell ; the small Chicago - based newsweekly In These Times , which published a condensed version of this writer 's findings ; and Alexander Cockburn , who devoted a series of columns in The Nation exposing the hoax . ... The periodicals in which From Time Immemorial had already been favorably reviewed refused to run any critical correspondence e.g. The New Republic , The Atlantic Monthly , Commentary . Periodicals that had yet to review the book rejected a manuscript on the subject as of little or no consequence e.g. The Village Voice , Dissent , The New York Review of Books . Not a single national newspaper or columnist contacted found newsworthy that a best - selling , effusively praised ' study ' of the Middle East conflict was a threadbare hoax . 
The equivalent strengths of the different armor plates was as follows : 15 in 381 mm of wrought iron was equivalent to 12 in 305 mm of either plain steel or compound iron and steel armor , and to 7 . 75 in 197 mm of Harvey armor or 5 . 75 in 146 mm of Krupp armor .
As noted above , variants that deviate from this template are known ; what designates a Nazarov cyclization in particular is the generation of the pentadienyl cation followed by electrocyclic ring closure to an oxyallyl cation . In order to achieve this transformation , the molecule must be in the s - trans s - trans conformation , placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation . The propensity of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate , with - substituted substrates having an increased population of the requisite conformer due to allylic strain . Coordination of an electron donating - substituent by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation .

In a mixed review , Nick Catucci of The Village Voice felt that Furtado sauces up a bit too luridly and lacks chemistry with Timbaland , writing that Loose isn 't a love child , but a bump - and - grind that never finds a groove . Vibe stated , she loses herself in Gwen Stefani like posturing , as on Glow , and ethnic fusions like No Hay Igual or Te Busqu . In his consumer guide for The Village Voice , Robert Christgau gave the album a B and named it dud of the month , indicating a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought . Christgau viewed that its dance - oriented tracks might accomplish God 's great plan on the dance - floor . But as songs they 're not much .

On the evening of 22 November 1914 , the Grand Fleet conducted a fruitless sweep in the southern half of the North Sea to support Vice Admiral David Beatty 's 1st Battlecruiser Squadron . The fleet was back in port in Scapa Flow by 27 November . Marlborough and most of the fleet initially remained in port during the German raid on Scarborough , Hartlepool and Whitby on 16 December 1914 , though the 3rd Battle Squadron was sent to reinforce the British forces in the area . After receiving further information about the possibility of the rest of the German fleet being at sea , Jellicoe gave the order for the fleet to sortie to try to intercept the Germans , though by that time they had already retreated . Vice Admiral Cecil Burney replaced Bayley aboard Marlborough in December ; at that time , Marlborough became the second - in - command flagship for the Grand Fleet . On 25 December , the fleet sortied for a sweep in the North Sea , which concluded on 27 December without event . Marlborough and the rest of the fleet conducted gunnery drills during 10 13 January 1915 west of the Orkneys and Shetlands . On the evening of 23 January , the bulk of the Grand Fleet sailed in support of Beatty 's Battlecruiser Fleet but the rest of the fleet did not become engaged in the ensuing Battle of Dogger Bank the following day .
The black - tailed jackrabbit occupies plant communities with a mixture of shrubs , grasses , and forbs . Shrubland - herb mosaics are preferred over pure stands of shrubs or herbs . Black - tailed jackrabbit populations are common in sagebrush Artemisia spp . , creosotebush Larrea tridentata , and other desert shrublands ; palouse , shortgrass , and mixed - grass prairies ; desert grassland ; open - canopy chaparral ; oak Quercus spp . , and pinyon - juniper Pinus - Juniperus spp . woodlands ; and early seral succeeding each other , low- to mid - elevation coniferous forests . It is also common in and near croplands , especially alfalfa Medicago sativa fields .
The fictional character Stingaree proved to be a prototype of a character Hornung used in a series of six short stories published in 1898 in Cassell 's Magazine , A. J. Raffles . The character was modelled on George Cecil Ives , a Cambridge - educated criminologist and talented cricketer who , like Raffles , was a resident of the Albany , a gentlemen 's only residence in Mayfair . The first tale of the series In the Chains of Crime was published in June that year , titled The Ides of March . The stories were collected into one volume with two additional tales under the name The Amateur Cracksman , which was published the following year . Hornung used a narrative form similar to Doyle 's Sherlock Holmes stories , with Raffles and his partner - in - crime and former school fag Bunny Manders being the criminal counterparts to Holmes and Dr. Watson although Rowland writes that Raffles and Manders were also fictionalized versions of Wilde and Bosie Wilde 's lover , Lord Alfred Douglas . and he dedicated the stories to his brother - in - law : To A.C.D. This form of flattery . Doyle had warned against writing the stories , and reflected in his memoirs that there are few finer examples of short - story writing in our language than these , though I confess I think they are rather dangerous in their suggestion . I told him so before he put pen to paper , and the result has , I fear , borne me out . You must not make the criminal the hero . The book was a popular and financial success , although some critics also echoed Doyle 's fears . The reviewer in The Spectator wrote that stern moralists would consider the book 's premise as a new , ingenious , artistic , but most reprehensible application of the crude principles involved in the old - fashioned hero - worship of Jack Sheppard and Dick Turpin . The book ends with Manders imprisoned and Raffles apparently dead , something that left The Spectator reviewer expressing their satisfaction that this audaciously entertaining volume is not issued in a cheap form . It is emphatically a feat of virtuosity rather than a tribute to virtue . 
Alfa Ba , Karamoko Alfa 's father , formed a coalition of Muslim Fulbe and called for the jihad in 1725 , but died before the struggle began . The jihad was launched around 1726 or 1727 . The movement was primarily religious , and its leaders included both Mand and Fulbe marabouts . The jihad also attracted some formerly non - Muslim Fulbe , who associated it not just with Islam but with freedom of the Fulbe from subordination to the Mand peoples . It was opposed by other non - Muslim Fulbe and by non - Muslim Yalunka leaders .
For the 1913 fiscal year , the General Board of the United States Navy determined that six destroyers would be authorized . The design for Destroyers No. 51 through No. 56 what became the O 'Brien class , was to closely follow the design of the Cassin and Aylwin classes from fiscal year 1912 . The chief of the U.S. Navy 's Bureau of Ordnance BuOrd suggested that the new destroyers be equipped with ten torpedo tubes and urged that the new 21 - inch 533 mm torpedo be adopted . The General Board agreed in principle , adopting the 21 - inch torpedo tubes , but eliminated BuOrd 's proposed centerline torpedo tubes and keeping the number of tubes at eight , the same as the Cassin and Aylwin classes . The additional weight of the larger torpedoes , 5 long tons 5 . 1 t of top weight , was offset by reducing the planned two aft - facing guns to a single one . This gave the class four 4 - inch 102 mm guns , which , again , matched the battery of the Cassin and Aylwin classes . The design for the O 'Brien class was approved on 20 August 1912 , and authorized by Congress on 4 March 1913 .
In 1990 , the Missouri River watershed was home to about 12 million people . This included the entire population of the U.S. state of Nebraska , parts of the U.S. states of Colorado , Iowa , Kansas , Minnesota , Missouri , Montana , North Dakota , South Dakota , and Wyoming , and small southern portions of the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan . The watershed 's largest city is Denver , Colorado , with a population of more than six hundred thousand . Denver is the main city of the Front Range Urban Corridor whose cities had a combined population of over four million in 2005 , making it the largest metropolitan area in the Missouri River basin . Other major population centers mostly located in the southeastern portion of the watershed include Omaha , Nebraska , situated north of the confluence of the Missouri and Platte Rivers ; Kansas City , Missouri Kansas City , Kansas , located at the confluence of the Missouri with the Kansas River ; and the St. Louis metropolitan area , situated south of the Missouri River just below the latter 's mouth , on the Mississippi . In contrast , the northwestern part of the watershed is sparsely populated . However , many northwestern cities , such as Billings , Montana , are among the fastest growing in the Missouri basin .
Susan Hagan Ma Anand Su , a top official in the Rajneeshpuram hierarchy , was also a participant in the assassination conspiracy . Hagan was in charge of the security force at Rajneeshpuram , ran the Rajneesh Investment Corporation , and supervised construction on the commune . Other conspirators in the assassination plot included Ann Phyllis McCarthy Ma Yoga Vidya , president of the Rajneesh commune , and Alma Potter Ma Dhyan Yogini , Ma Anand Sheela 's bodyguard and traveling companion . Potter was manager of the Hotel Rajneesh in Portland , Oregon , and a member of the commune 's security force . The Oregonian reported that nine people were on the hit list , including : Turner , Frohnmayer , former assistant attorney general Karen H. Green , Wasco County planning director Daniel C. Durow , Wasco County commissioner James L. Comini , investigative journalist for The Oregonian Leslie L. Zaitz , former member Helen C.

Similar to Cajal bodies are Gemini of Cajal bodies , or gems , whose name is derived from the Gemini constellation in reference to their close twin relationship with CBs . Gems are similar in size and shape to CBs , and in fact are virtually indistinguishable under the microscope . Unlike CBs , gems do not contain small nuclear ribonucleoproteins snRNPs , but do contain a protein called survival of motor neuron SMN whose function relates to snRNP biogenesis . Gems are believed to assist CBs in snRNP biogenesis , though it has also been suggested from microscopy evidence that CBs and gems are different manifestations of the same structure . Later ultrastructural studies have shown gems to be twins of Cajal bodies with the difference being in the coilin component ; Cajal bodies are SMN positive and coilin positive , and gems are SMN positive and coilin negative .

This model was inspired by Sweden , where a separate dining company had been established ; this company paid the railway company part of its revenue and a fixed fee per restaurant carriage . The Swedish model involved including the operation of station restaurants at locations where the restaurant carriages would have depots . On 21 December 1918 , A.S Norsk Spisevognselskap was established with a share capital of 200 , 000 Norwegian krone NOK . It had 20 shares ; 17 were owned by the Trunk Railway , and one by each of three directors : Waldemar Stoud Platou , Gotfred Furuholmen and Christian Emil Stoud Platou the former representing the Trunk Railway and the latter being director - general of the NSB . In January 1919 , Waldemar Platou was appointed chair and Christiansen managing director . The company took over Christiansen 's four restaurant carriages and the restaurant at Oslo on 1 April 1919 .

The precursor to Tropical Storm Gilda was a large convective system partially due to a tropical wave . It gradually became better organized over the northwestern Caribbean Sea , and on October 15 , a tropical depression formed off the coast of Nicaragua . As it drifted to the northeast , it strengthened to a tropical storm , peaking at 70 mph 110 km h winds . Before it hit the coast of Cuba , it weakened enough to cause only minor damage . By the time it struck the island , it had become very disorganized in nature .

The French convoy , escorted by Vanstabel , departed America from Virginia on 2 April , and Howe sailed from Portsmouth on 2 May , taking his entire fleet to both escort British convoys to the Western Approaches and intercept the French . Checking that Villaret was still in Brest , Howe spent two weeks searching the Bay of Biscay for the grain convoy , returning to Brest on 18 May to discover that Villaret had sailed the previous day . Note C Returning to sea in search of his opponent , Howe pursued Villaret deep into the Atlantic . Also at sea during this period were the squadrons of Nielly French and Montagu British , both of whom had met with some success ; Nielly had captured a number of British merchant ships and Montagu had taken several back . Nielly was the first to encounter the grain convoy , deep in the Atlantic in the second week of May . He took it under escort as it moved closer to Europe , while Montagu was searching fruitlessly to the south .

Boats of the Type UB I design were built by two manufacturers , Germaniawerft of Kiel and AG Weser of Bremen , which led to some variations in boats from the two shipyards . The eight Germaniawerft - built boats were slightly longer at 28 . 10 metres 92 ft 2 in length overall , while the twelve Weser - built boats came in 22 centimetres 8 . 7 in shorter than their counterparts . All were 3 . 15 metres 10 ft 4 in abeam and had a draft of 3 . 03 metres 9 ft 11 in . The boats all displaced 127 tonnes 125 long tons while surfaced , but differed slightly in displacement submerged . The slightly longer Germaniawerft boats displaced 142 tonnes 140 long tons while submerged , as they weighed 1 tonne 0 . 98 long tons more than the Weser boats .
With the Visayan - born Arsenio Lacson as its first elected mayor in 1952 all mayors were appointed prior to this , Manila underwent The Golden Age , once again earning its status as the Pearl of the Orient , a moniker it earned before the Second World War . After Lacson 's term in the 1950s , Manila was led by Antonio Villegas for most of the 1960s . Ramon Bagatsing an Indian - Filipino was mayor for nearly the entire 1970s until the 1986 People Power Revolution . Mayors Lacson , Villegas , and Bagatsing are often collectively considered as the Big Three of Manila less for their rather long tenures as the city 's chief executive continuously for over three decades , from 1952 1986 , but more for their indelible contribution to the development and progress of the city and their lasting legacy in uplifting the quality of life and welfare of the people of Manila .
Additionally , oxidation of chiral imines and oxidation of imines with chiral peracids may yield enantiopure oxaziridines . Some oxaziridines have the unique property of configurationally stable nitrogen atoms at room temperature due to an inversion barrier of 24 to 31 kcal mol . Enantiopure oxaziridines where stereochemistry is entirely due to configurationally stable nitrogen are reported .
Applewhite believed in the ancient astronaut hypothesis , which claimed that extraterrestrials had visited humanity in the past and placed humans on Earth and would return to collect a select few . Parts of this teaching bear similarities to the Reformed Christian concept of election , likely owing to Applewhite 's Presbyterian upbringing . He often discussed extraterrestrials using phrases from Star Trek and stated that aliens communicated with him through the show .
The Great Coastal hurricane of 1806 was first noted far east of the Lesser Antilles on 17 August . Weather historian David M. Ludlum followed the disturbance 's track to the Bahamas by 19 August ; intense winds persisted until 21 August , however , approximately 150 mi 240 km east of the Bahamian island of Eleuthera . Steering currents brought the storm northward , and it approached Charleston , South Carolina on 22 August , where a generally easterly flow preceded the storm indicated its passage far east of the city . The hurricane made landfall at the mouth of the Cape Fear River in North Carolina later that day , though the earliest impacts from the storm started several days earlier , with gusts initially toward the northeast but later curving southwestward . Reports of similar wind shifts throughout the region suggested that the gale persisted , stationary , for several hours . It eventually moved back out to sea while south of Norfolk , Virginia , departing the region on 24 August . The hurricane maintained 1 - minute maximum sustained winds of 110 mph 175 km h while offshore , equivalent to a Category 2 system on the Saffir Simpson hurricane wind scale . While offshore New England , the gale featured a swath of winds 90 mi 150 km wide , and was last observed just south of Nova Scotia on 25 August slightly weaker , with sustained winds of 75 mph 120 km h .
Mega Man Bass was developed for the Super Famicom after the release of Mega Man 8 , which preceded Mega Man Bass on the two 32 - bit consoles , the PlayStation and Sega Saturn . According to series producer Keiji Inafune , Mega Man Bass was intended for younger players who still owned a Super Famicom and did not have the means to experience Mega Man 8 on one of the newer systems . Even though trying to bridge out a new title on the Super Famicom was a little backwards at the time , we didn 't want to make a half - hearted attempt at it , Inafune explained . The design team included several new employees , as well as members of previous Mega Man games . Inafune required them to make the game as hardcore as possible . Designer Hideki Ishikawa recalled the development of Mega Man Bass as one big party . The staff attempted to create an original game while avoiding the same old , same old ... pitfall that so many long video game series suffer and had a lot of fun doing it .
Bosi uses molecular gastronomy techniques , such as in the process for making a Savoy cabbage pur e , in which the cabbage is freeze dried into a powder and then reconstituted , but he prefers only to enhance the flavours of individual ingredients rather than changing those flavours by using unusual techniques .
In contrast to much theatre of the time , The Importance of Being Earnest 's light plot does not tackle serious social and political issues , something of which contemporary reviewers were wary . Though unsure of Wilde 's seriousness as a dramatist , they recognised the play 's cleverness , humour and popularity with audiences . George Bernard Shaw , for example , reviewed the play in the Saturday Review , arguing that comedy should touch as well as amuse , I go to the theatre to be moved to laughter . Later in a letter he said , the play , though extremely funny , was Wilde 's first really heartless one . In The World , William Archer wrote that he had enjoyed watching the play but found it to be empty of meaning , What can a poor critic do with a play which raises no principle , whether of art or morals , creates its own canons and conventions , and is nothing but an absolutely wilful expression of an irrepressibly witty personality ? 
There is no way I will be influenced to adopt such tactics which bring such discredit to the game . I know Tim could do it but I am not going to participate in actions that can only hurt the game .
Six singles were released from the album .

Also on that morning , the 200 Home Guard troops and about 50 armed locals in Avtovac were attacked from three directions by rebels . They recovered from their initial surprise and held the town during the day , but in the evening a renewed assault caused them to withdraw from Avtovac and retreat to the villages of Me ulji i and Klju . Upon capturing Avtovac , the rebels looted the village , burned down a large number of Muslim homes and killed 32 Muslim civilians , mostly women , children and the elderly . Gacko was also attacked by the rebels , with eight soldiers killed , and one officer and 12 soldiers wounded . Also on 28 June , two Italian Army trucks driving from Bile a to Avtovac were ambushed by rebels , who killed three soldiers and wounded 17 .

Club wrote , Though Wyatt 's vocals recall a sad - faced Peter Gabriel , the song is steeped in the kind of effervescent magic that makes Lykke Li and Peter Bjorn and John stars in their own right . Evan Sawdey of PopMatters was critical of Wyatt 's vocal performance ; he wrote that we really get a sense of how Wyatt 's voice hinders the group . He said that the singer intones the lyrics somewhat abstractly , but with absolutely no sense of gravity to be found in his voice at all .

The disagreements between the leading barons involved in the revolt soon became evident . Montfort championed radical reforms that would place further limitations on the authority and power of the major barons as well as the Crown ; others promoted only moderate change , while the conservative barons expressed concerns about the existing limitations on the King 's powers . Over the next four years , neither Henry nor the barons were able to restore stability in England , and power swung back and forth between the different factions . By early 1263 , what remained of Henry 's authority had disintegrated and the country slipped back towards open civil war . Montfort convened a council of rebel barons in Oxford to pursue his radical agenda and by October , England faced a likely civil war . Montfort marched east with an army and London rose up in revolt . Montfort took Henry and Queen Eleanor prisoner , and although he maintained a fiction of ruling in Henry 's name , the rebels completely replaced the royal government and household with their own , trusted men .

The long jump is one of the oldest track and field events , having its roots as one of the events within the ancient Greek pentathlon contest . The athletes would take a short run up and jump into an area of dug up earth , with the winner being the one who jumped farthest . Small weights Halteres were held in each hand during the jump then swung back and dropped near the end to gain extra momentum and distance . The modern long jump , standardised in England and the United States around 1860 , bears resemblance to the ancient event although no weights are used . Athletes sprint along a length of track that leads to a jumping board and a sandpit . The athletes must jump before a marked line and their achieved distance is measured from the nearest point of sand disturbed by the athlete 's body .
In these investigations , Bedell quickly gained the support of small gasoline marketers and Congressman Bill Nelson .

Serious security gaps at Suvarnabhumi Airport became known to the public beginning in early 2007 . The International Air Transport Association IATA found that there were many spots in the passenger terminal where checked passengers can meet people who have not passed through security checks and could receive unchecked objects and then carry them on board aircraft . The IATA also suggested that AoT deploy its own security staff instead of contracting out the job to the Loxley - ICTS consortium . AoT threatened the consortium with contract termination , but didn 't follow through with its threat , even though the consortium failed to live up to its contract . Six months later , AoT stated that it still couldn 't make up its mind on how it should improve airport security . AoT said it was open to all possible options , and has taken no action to upgrade the problem .

Europium is a chemical element with symbol Eu and atomic number 63 . It was isolated in 1901 and is named after the continent of Europe . It is a moderately hard , silvery metal which readily oxidizes in air and water . Being a typical member of the lanthanide series , europium usually assumes the oxidation state 3 , but the oxidation state 2 is also common : all europium compounds with oxidation state 2 are slightly reducing . Europium has no significant biological role and is relatively non - toxic compared to other heavy metals . Most applications of europium exploit the phosphorescence of europium compounds . Europium is one of the least abundant elements in the universe ; only about 5 10 8 of all matter in the universe is europium .

Researchers are investigating the clinical significance of c - KIT mutations in AML . These are prevalent , and potentially clinically relevant because of the availability of tyrosine kinase inhibitors , such as imatinib and sunitinib that can block the activity of c - KIT pharmacologically . It is expected that additional markers e.g. , RUNX1 , ASXL1 , and TP53 that have consistently been associated with an inferior outcome will soon be included in these recommendations . The prognostic importance of other mutated genes e.g. , DNMT3A , IDH1 , IDH2 is less clear .
Since 1993 , the proportion of lbws in each English season has risen steadily . According to cricket historian Douglas Miller , the percentage of lbw dismissals increased after broadcasters incorporated ball - tracking technology such as Hawk - Eye into their television coverage of matches . Miller writes : With the passage of time and the adoption of Hawkeye into other sports , together with presentations demonstrating its accuracy , cricket followers seem gradually to have accepted its predictions . Replay analyses have shown that a greater proportion of balls striking an outstretched leg go on to hit the wicket than had once been expected . He also suggests that umpires have been influenced by such evidence ; their greater understanding of which deliveries are likely to hit the stumps has made them more likely to rule out batsmen who are standing further away from the stumps . This trend is replicated in international cricket , where the increasing use of technology in reviewing decisions has altered the attitude of umpires . Spin bowlers in particular win far more appeals for lbw . However , the use of on - field technology has proved controversial ; some critics regard it as more reliable than human judgement , while others believe that the umpire is better placed to make the decision .
Popular was uncertain of the sales potential for the two new titles and decided to publish them under its Fictioneers imprint , which was used for lower - paying magazines . Super Science Stories ' first issue was dated March 1940 ; it was bimonthly , with Astonishing Stories appearing in the alternate months . In Pohl 's memoirs he recalls Harry Steeger , one of the company owners , breaking down the budget for Astonishing for him : Two hundred seventy - five dollars for stories . A hundred dollars for black and white art . Thirty dollars for a cover . For Super Science Stories , Steeger gave him an additional 50 as it was 16 pages longer , so his total budget was 455 per issue . Pohl could only offer half a cent per word for fiction , well below the rates offered by the leading magazines . Super Science Stories sold well , despite Pohl 's limited resources : Popular was a major pulp publisher and had a strong distribution network , which helped circulation . Steeger soon increased Pohl 's budget , to pay bonuses for popular stories . Pohl later commented that he was uncertain whether the additional funds really helped to bring in higher quality submissions , although at the time he assured Steeger it would improve the magazine . Some of the additional money went to Ray Cummings , a long - established sf writer who came to see Pohl in person to submit his work . Cummings refused to sell for less than one cent a word ; Pohl had some extra money available when Cummings first visited him , and though he disliked Cummings ' work was never able to bring himself to reject Cummings submissions , or even to tell him that he could not really afford to pay the rate Cummings was asking . Pohl comments in his memoirs that for months he Cummings would turn up regularly as clockwork and sell me a new story ; I hated them all , and bought them all .

The first designation for K - 22 was established by 1927 and ran from US - 54 near Liberal to US - 36 near Halford . During this time , most of the route was a dirt road , except for a portion near Garden City , which was paved . This routing was relinquished by 1932 . By 1933 , a new routing was created , and the road instead began in Wichita , headed east along US - 54 to Eureka and north to Emporia . From Emporia , the route turned northeast toward Scranton and north into Topeka . This designation was decommissioned between January and July 1938 . The current designation of K - 22 was established in 1941 . No alignment changes have taken place since then .

The new capital Hangzhou grew into a major commercial and cultural center . It rose from a middling city of no special importance to one of the world 's largest and most prosperous . During his stay in Hangzhou in the Yuan dynasty 1260 1368 , when the city was not as wealthy as it had been under the Song , Marco Polo remarked that this city is greater than any in the world .

Other significant parties formed in the era were the Serb People 's Independent Party , which later formed the Croat - Serb Coalition with the Party of Rights and other Croat and Serb parties . The Coalition ruled Croatia between 1903 and 1918 . The leaders of the Coalition were Frano Supilo and Svetozar Pribi evi . The Croatian Peasant Party HSS , established in 1904 and led by Stjepan Radi , advocated Croatian autonomy but achieved only moderate gains by 1918 . In Dalmatia , the two major parties were the People 's Party a branch of the People 's Party active in Croatia - Slavonia and the Autonomist Party , advocating maintaining autonomy of Dalmatia , opposite to the People 's Party demands for unification of Croatia - Slavonia and Dalmatia . The Autonomist Party , most notably led by Antonio Bajamonti , was also linked to Italian irredentism . By 1900 , the Party of Rights had made considerable gains in Dalmatia . The Autonomists won the first three elections , but all elections since 1870 were won by the People 's Party . In the period 1861 1918 there were seventeen elections in the Kingdom of Croatia - Slavonia and ten in the Kingdom of Dalmatia .
Experienced condom users are significantly less likely to have a condom slip or break compared to first - time users , although users who experience one slippage or breakage are more likely to suffer a second such failure . An article in Population Reports suggests that education on condom use reduces behaviors that increase the risk of breakage and slippage . A Family Health International publication also offers the view that education can reduce the risk of breakage and slippage , but emphasizes that more research needs to be done to determine all of the causes of breakage and slippage .
In 1982 , Braathens SAFE bought 15 of DNL . It also applied , though the sister company Braathens Helikopter , for concessions for helicopter services from Stavanger to offshore oil platforms . As a reaction , the incumbent , Helikopter Service , applied for Braathens SAFEs West Coast routes . At this point , SAS bought 15 of Helikopter Service . In 1984 , Braathens SAFE introduced services to Farsund Airport , using wet leased F - 27s from Busy Bee . The same arrangement was used to connect Haugesund to Bergen and Stavanger . In Haugesund , this was in competition with Norving . Busy Bee - operated planes were also used on routes from Sandefjord in competition with Norsk Flytjeneste . The same year , the cabin crew had a 14 - day strike , halting all flights . It was caused by the company paying lower wages than SAS and Busy Bee . In 1985 , a new booking system was introduced , that allowed overbooking . This gave increased revenue , but the company had to start compensating rejected passengers with a full refund and a free seat on the next flight . On 16 December 1985 , the airline 's administration moved into the a new building , the Diamond , located at Fornebu . The frequent flyer program Bracard was launched in September 1985 .

Directed acyclic graphs representations of partial orderings have many applications in scheduling for systems of tasks with ordering constraints . An important class of problems of this type concern collections of objects that need to be updated , such as the cells of a spreadsheet after one of the cells has been changed , or the object files of a piece of computer software after its source code has been changed . In this context , a dependency graph is a graph that has a vertex for each object to be updated , and an edge connecting two objects whenever one of them needs to be updated earlier than the other . A cycle in this graph is called a circular dependency , and is generally not allowed , because there would be no way to consistently schedule the tasks involved in the cycle . Dependency graphs without circular dependencies form DAGs .

From 1971 through to the late 1980s , Australian directors began to take advantage of the newly introduced R - rating which allowed more on - screen nudity , sex and violence for audiences restricted to age 18 and over . Ozploitation writer - director Mark Hartley 's own portmanteau of Australian exploitation was a subgenre of the New Wave which accounted for the critically panned gross - out comedies , sex romps , action and road movies , teen films , westerns , thrillers and horror films of the era , commonly overlooked in Australia 's official film history . The film addresses three main categories of Ozploitation films : sex , horror and action .

Players must be prepared to learn , and indeed re - learn , to the absolute point of mastery , the basic principles of Rugby Union football . This started the coaching revolution . The WRU Coaching Committee set up in the late 1950s was given the task of improving the quality of coaching and , in January 1967 , Ray Williams was appointed Coaching Organiser . The first national coach , David Nash , was appointed in 1967 to coach Wales for the season , but resigned when the WRU refused to allow him to accompany Wales on their 1968 tour of Argentina . Eventually , the WRU reversed their decision , appointing Clive Rowlands to tour as coach . Of the six matches , Wales won three , drew two and lost one .
The Amylostereaceae are white rot pathogens . They disintegrate the lignin of the host wood , whereby the infested wood parts become less stable and take a fibrous structure . The wood bleaches as fungal enzymes break down and remove the brown - pigmented lignin . The distribution in wood takes place mainly along the transport channels in the xylem . If the wood is crosscut , the red rot is vertically positioned , on which bleached , infested areas contrast with intact wood . Symptoms of infestion by the symbiotic partner wood wasps include circular exit holes in the crust and acute stress through dryness , common in hanging , falling or tanning needles .
Common starlings are both monogamous and polygamous ; although broods are generally brought up by one male and one female , occasionally the pair may have an extra helper . Pairs may be part of a colony , in which case several other nests may occupy the same or nearby trees . Males may mate with a second female while the first is still on the nest . The reproductive success of the bird is poorer in the second nest than it is in the primary nest and is better when the male remains monogamous .
From All Saints , Olivier went on to St Edward 's School , Oxford , from 1920 to 1924 . He made little mark until his final year , when he played Puck in the school 's production of A Midsummer Night 's Dream ; his performance was a tour de force that won him popularity among his fellow pupils . In January 1924 , his brother left England to work in India as a rubber planter . Olivier missed him greatly and asked his father how soon he could follow . He recalled in his memoirs that his father replied , Don 't be such a fool , you 're not going to India , you 're going on the stage . 
Divine behavior was believed to govern all of nature . Except for the few deities who disrupted the divine order , the gods ' actions maintained maat and created and sustained all living things . They did this work using a force the Egyptians called heka , a term usually translated as magic . Heka was a fundamental power that the creator god used to form the world and the gods themselves .

Amylostereum chailletiiz is common in the temperate regions of North America and Eurasia . A. laevigatum can be also found in temperate Eurasia , but it is unclear how broadly this species is distributed in North America . A. areolatum is originally native in North Africa and Eurasia ; it was however distributed through the 20th century in Australia , New Zealand , Southern Africa as well as in South and North America . Only A. ferreum is originally native in the tropics and is common in Brazil and the Caribbean .
The Romanian Land Forces have completely overhauled their equipment in the past few years , replacing it with a more modern one . The TR - 85M1 Bizon main battle tank and the MLI - 84M Jder infantry fighting vehicle are the most modern native made equipment of the Romanian Land Forces . Also , 43 ex - German Gepard anti - aircraft systems were commissioned in late - 2004 .
On September 25 , 2001 , Jordan announced his return to the NBA to play for the Washington Wizards , indicating his intention to donate his salary as a player to a relief effort for the victims of the September 11 , 2001 attacks . In an injury - plagued 2001 02 season , he led the team in scoring 22 . 9 ppg , assists 5 . 2 apg , and steals 1 . 42 spg . However , torn cartilage in his right knee ended Jordan 's season after only 60 games , the fewest he had played in a regular season since playing 17 games after returning from his first retirement during the 1994 95 season . Jordan started 53 of his 60 games for the season , averaging 24 . 3 points , 5 . 4 assists , and 6 . 0 rebounds , and shooting 41 . 9 from the field in his 53 starts . His last seven appearances were in a reserve role , in which he averaged just over 20 minutes per game .
Affirmation , when not in conflict with negation , yields the desired result of describing truly an object of knowledge . Only when affirmation and negation are juxtaposed in mutually non - conflicting situation , one is able to decide whether to accept or reject the assertion . This is how the doctrine of conditional predications sy dv da establishes the truth . 
The 3d Marine Division began operating in Vietnam when on March 6 , 1965 , they opened a Marine Compound at the Da Nang Air Base .

Cure rates in clinical trials have ranged from 20 45 ; although clinical trials often include only younger people and those able to tolerate aggressive therapies . The overall cure rate for all people with AML including the elderly and those unable to tolerate aggressive therapy is likely lower . Cure rates for promyelocytic leukemia can be as high as 98 .
Though Frank recovered from the slide and achieved a peak population of 1 , 000 shortly thereafter , the closure of the mine resulted in a longstanding decline in population . Frank ceased to be an independent community in 1979 when it was amalgamated into the Municipality of Crowsnest Pass along with the neighbouring communities of Blairmore , Coleman , Hillcrest and Bellevue . Frank is now home to about 200 residents .

In 1955 , Allen Newell and future Nobel Laureate Herbert A. Simon created the Logic Theorist with help from J. C. Shaw . The program would eventually prove 38 of the first 52 theorems in Russell and Whitehead 's Principia Mathematica , and find new and more elegant proofs for some . Simon said that they had solved the venerable mind body problem , explaining how a system composed of matter can have the properties of mind . This was an early statement of the philosophical position John Searle would later call Strong AI : that machines can contain minds just as human bodies do . 
Calvert had long maintained an interest in the exploration and settlement of the New World , beginning with his investment of twenty - five pounds in the second Virginia Company in 1609 , and a few months later a more substantial sum in the East India Company , which he increased in 1614 . In 1620 , Calvert purchased a tract of land in Newfoundland from Sir William Vaughan , 1575 - 1641 , a Welsh writer and colonial investor , who had earlier failed to establish a colony on the large sub - Arctic island off the eastern coast of North America . He named the area of the peninsula as Avalon , after the legendary spot where Christianity was supposedly introduced to Roman Britain in ancient times . The plantation lay on what is now called the Avalon Peninsula and included the fishing station at Ferryland . Calvert almost certainly had a fishery project in mind at this stage .
On a practical level for the music professional , the speaker is analytic and clinical - sounding . Gizmodo likened the NS - 10 to music editors who reveal the weaknesses of recordings , so that engineers would be forced to either make necessary compensation in the mix or otherwise rework them .
English theologian Richard Holt Hutton summarized the poem as Tennyson 's friendly picture of the insatiable craving for new experience , enterprise , and adventure , when under the control of a luminous reason and a self - controlled will . The contemporary poet Matthew Arnold was early in observing the narrative irony of the poem : he found Ulysses ' speech the least plain , the most un - Homeric , which can possibly be conceived . Homer presents his thought to you just as it wells from the source of his mind : Mr. Tennyson carefully distils his thought before he will part with it . Hence comes ... a heightened and elaborate air . 
On October 11 , 1142 , after about a year of negotiations , the Treaty of Shaoxing was ratified , ending the conflict between the Jin and the Song . By the terms of the treaty , the Huai River , north of the Yangtze , was designated as the boundary between the two empires . The Song agreed to pay a yearly tribute of 250 , 000 taels of silver and 250 , 000 packs of silk to the Jin .
In the summer the fieldfare frequents mixed woodland of birch , alder , pine , spruce and fir , often near marshes , moorland or other open ground . It does not avoid the vicinity of humans and can be seen in cultivated areas , orchards , parks and gardens . It also inhabits open tundra and the slopes of hills above the tree line . In the winter , groups of fieldfares are chiefly found in open country , agricultural land , orchards and open woodland . They are nomadic , wandering wherever there is an abundance of berries and insects . Later in the year they move on to pastureland and cultivated fields .
Temnospondyls are placed as basal tetrapods in phylogenetic analyses , with their exact positioning varying between studies . Depending on the classification of modern amphibians , they are either included in the crown group Tetrapoda or the stem of Tetrapoda . Crown - group tetrapods are descendants of the most recent common ancestor of all living tetrapods and stem tetrapods are forms that are outside the crown group . Modern amphibians have recently been suggested as descendants of temnospondyls , which would place them within crown Tetrapoda . Below is a cladogram from Ruta et al . 2003 placing Temnospondyli within crown Tetrapoda :
The film presents Ricky as its visionary , ... spiritual and mystical center . He sees beauty in the minutiae of everyday life , videoing as much as he can for fear of missing it . He shows Jane what he considers the most beautiful thing he has filmed : a plastic bag , tossing in the wind in front of a wall . He says capturing the moment was when he realized that there was an entire life behind things ; he feels that sometimes there 's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can 't take it ... and my heart is going to cave in . Anker argues that Ricky , in looking past the cultural dross , has grasped the radiant splendor of the created world to see God . As the film progresses , the Burnhams move closer to Ricky 's view of the world . Lester only forswears personal satisfaction at the film 's end . On the cusp of having sex with Angela , he returns to himself after she admits her virginity . Suddenly confronted with a child , he begins to treat her as a daughter ; in doing so , Lester sees himself , Angela , and his family for the poor and fragile but wondrous creatures they are . He looks at a picture of his family in happier times , and dies having had an epiphany that infuses him with wonder , joy , and soul - shaking gratitude he has finally seen the world as it is .
Jagannadh wrote the film 's story , screenplay and dialogue with Meher Ramesh assisting him as script associate . Though having worked with Chakri many times in the past , at Mahesh 's suggestion , Jagannadh instead chose Mani Sharma to compose the film 's music . Shyam K. Naidu was the film 's cinematographer and Marthand K. Venkatesh its editor . Chinna and Krishna were the film 's art director and executive producer respectively .
The cougar is also protected across much of the rest of its range . As of 1996 , cougar hunting was prohibited in Argentina , Brazil , Bolivia , Chile , Colombia , Costa Rica , French Guiana , Guatemala , Honduras , Nicaragua , Panama , Paraguay , Suriname , Venezuela , and Uruguay . The cat had no reported legal protection in Ecuador , El Salvador , and Guyana . Regulated cougar hunting is still common in the United States and Canada , although they are protected from all hunting in the Yukon ; it is permitted in every U.S. state from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean , with the exception of California . Texas is the only state in the United States with a viable population of cougars that does not protect that population in some way . In Texas , cougars are listed as nuisance wildlife and any person holding a hunting or a trapping permit can kill a cougar regardless of the season , number killed , sex or age of the animal . Killed animals are not required to be reported to Texas Parks and Wildlife Department . Conservation work in Texas is the effort of a non - profit organization , Balanced Ecology Inc BEI , as part of their Texas Mountain Lion Conservation Project . Cougars are generally hunted with packs of dogs , until the animal is ' treed ' . When the hunter arrives on the scene , he shoots the cat from the tree at close range . The cougar cannot be legally killed without a permit in California except under very specific circumstances , such as when a cougar is in act of pursuing livestock or domestic animals , or is declared a threat to public safety . Permits are issued when owners can prove property damage on their livestock or pets . For example , multiple dogs have been attacked and killed , sometimes while with the owner . Many attribute this to the protection cougars have from being hunted and are now becoming desensitized to humans ; most are removed from the population after the attacks have already occurred . Statistics from the Department of Fish and Game indicate that cougar killings in California have been on the rise since the 1970s with an average of over 112 cats killed per year from 2000 to 2006 compared to six per year in the 1970s . They also state on their website that there is a healthy number of cougars in California . The Bay Area Puma Project aims to obtain information on cougar populations in the San Francisco Bay area and the animals ' interactions with habitat , prey , humans , and residential communities .
Townsend 's next project took several years to come to fruition . After the creation of the IR8 demo tape , Townsend and Jason Newsted had begun work on a new project called Fizzicist , which they described as heavier than Strapping Young Lad . When the IR8 tape was leaked , Newsted 's Metallica bandmates James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich learned of the project . Hetfield was fucking pissed that Newsted was playing outside the band , and Newsted was prevented by his bandmates from working on any more side projects . With the project stalled , Townsend instead wrote the album himself , entitling it Physicist . Townsend assembled his Strapping Young Lad bandmates to record it , the only time this lineup was featured on a Devin Townsend album . The thrash - influenced Physicist was released in June 2000 , and is generally considered a low point in Townsend 's career . Hoglan and the rest of the band were dissatisfied with the way the sound was mixed , and Townsend considers it his worst album to date .

UB - 1 and the still incomplete UB - 15 were sold to the Austria - Hungary in February 1915 ; both were dismantled and shipped to Pola in May . After one cruise under the German flag , each boat was commissioned into the Austro - Hungarian Navy . The pair renamed U - 10 and U - 11 , respectively were joined by U - 15 , U - 16 , and U - 17 in October . Known as the U - 10 or the Okarina English : Ocarina class as a part of the Austro - Hungarian Navy , the five boats operated primarily in the Adriatic in patrols off Italy and Albania . U - 10 ex UB - 1 hit a mine in July 1918 and was beached , but had not been repaired by the end of the war . U - 16 was sunk after she torpedoed an Italian destroyer in October 1916 , and the remaining three and the unrepaired U - 10 were ceded to Italy at the end of the war .
Garth Ennis ' run is also much loved , particularly Dangerous Habits , which was voted the best Garth Ennis story on Comic Book Resources , ahead of his work on Preacher , The Boys and The Punisher . In the same article Brian Cronin describes John 's one time love , Kit Ryan , as one of the series ' most memorable characters . The popularity of Ennis and Dillon 's run on Hellblazer is also credited for Vertigo agreeing to publish their seminal series Preacher .

In 2005 , RedOctane , a company specializing in the manufacture of unique game controllers , was inspired to create Guitar Hero based on RedOctane 's experience creating hardware for Konami 's Guitar Freaks arcade game . They enlisted Harmonix , who previously developed several music video games , for development assistance . The first game in the series was made on a budget of 1 million . The series became extremely successful , leading to the acquisition of RedOctane by Activision in 2007 . Harmonix was acquired by MTV Games and went on to create the Rock Band series of music games in the same vein as Guitar Hero . Activision brought Neversoft primarily known for their Tony Hawk series of skateboarding games on board for future development duties . Additional companies , such as Budcat Creations and Vicarious Visions have assisted in the adaptation of the games for other systems .

On 20 January at 06 : 03 local time 11 : 03 UTC the strongest aftershock since the earthquake , measuring magnitude 5 . 9 Mw , struck Haiti . USGS reported its epicenter was about 56 km 35 mi WSW of Port - au - Prince , which would place it almost exactly under the coastal town of Petit - Go ve . A UN representative reported that the aftershock collapsed seven buildings in the town . According to staff of the International Committee of the Red Cross , which had reached Petit - Go ve for the first time the day before the aftershock , the town was estimated to have lost 15 percent of its buildings , and was suffering the same shortages of supplies and medical care as the capital . Workers from the charity Save the Children reported hearing already weakened structures collapsing in Port - au - Prince , but most sources reported no further significant damage to infrastructure in the city . Further casualties are thought to have been minimal since people had been sleeping in the open . There are concerns that 12 January earthquake could be the beginning of a new long - term sequence : the whole region is fearful ; historical accounts , although not precise , suggest that there has been a sequence of quakes progressing westwards along the fault , starting with an earthquake in the Dominican Republic in 1751 .

Though Wilde deployed characters that were by now familiar the dandy lord , the overbearing matriarch , the woman with a past , the puritan young lady his treatment is subtler than in his earlier comedies . Lady Bracknell , for instance , embodies respectable , upper - class society , but Eltis notes how her development from the familiar overbearing duchess into a quirkier and more disturbing character can be traced through Wilde 's revisions of the play . For the two young men , Wilde presents not stereotypical stage dudes but intelligent beings who , as Jackson puts it , speak like their creator in well - formed complete sentences and rarely use slang or vogue - words . Dr Chasuble and Miss Prism are characterised by a few light touches of detail , their old - fashioned enthusiasms , and the Canon 's fastidious pedantry , pared down by Wilde during his many redrafts of the text .
At the beginning of the 19th century many parts of the Minnesota area were already well traveled by British and French explorers . Though the region 's population was mostly Native American , there were important British trading posts in the area with many European and mixed - race settlers , particularly in the north . Grand Portage , in particular , had long been established as the major trading center for the North West Company .
Liu Kang was the hero of the comic book adaptation of the Mortal Kombat series Malibu Comics . In the first miniseries , Blood and Thunder , his backstory was mostly kept intact as a Shaolin monk out to restore the tournament to their righteous owners , with the only difference being that he was not the chosen one to defeat Goro , which instead fell on twin monk brothers named Sing and Sang , two original characters created specifically for the comics ; after they are killed by Goro in the third issue , Liu Kang becomes the Shaolin 's only hope in defeating Shang Tsung . The following miniseries , Battlewave , stated that Liu Kang won the first tournament after defeating Goro , which never appeared in the first miniseries . He returns to his normal life as an architect in Chicago , having left the Order of Light before the events of the first series . However , he suffers from constant attacks by an unknown force of ninjas and later receives help from Johnny Cage 's bodyguard Bo when Goro ambushes him in an office building . Eventually he decides to travel to Outworld , realizing that he cannot avoid Mortal Kombat .

It was a lot of fun to grow up in that era . When a friend , Brandon Monk , had a basketball court installed in his back yard , Stevens appeared instantaneously . He was so dedicated to the game that he would bring the unprepared ingredients for grilled cheese sandwiches over to Monk 's house , so that he would not waste time waiting for the sandwiches to cook .
Ross also excelled in baseball , football , lacrosse and motorcycle racing . Before he became a hockey executive , he had a career as a bank clerk and ran a sporting - goods store in Montreal . Ross had moved to Brandon , Manitoba , in 1905 at the advice of his parents so he could get a job with a bank , with a salary of 600 per year . He gave that career up when he began playing hockey professionally . He was married to Muriel , a native of Montreal , and had two sons , Art and John . During the Second World War , both sons served in the Royal Canadian Air Force . After the war Ross made his son Art the business manager for the Bruins . Ross was named coach and manager of the Boston Bruins in 1924 and moved his family to Brookline , Massachusetts , a suburb of Boston , after being hired . In 1928 , he served as the traveling secretary of the Boston Braves baseball team , which was owned by Bruins owner Charles Adams . He became a naturalized American citizen on April 22 , 1938 .

Two other books have been optioned for films , but they have not been produced .
In the 1920s and 1930s , as mechanization became more prevalent , both wild and domesticated breeding stock diminished to almost nothing , and d 'Andrade , along with his son Fernando , encouraged the conservation of the breed . In 1937 , d 'Andrade began a small herd of his own with five stallions and seven mares from horses obtained near Coruche , Portugal . All Sorraias currently in captivity descend from these original horses obtained by d 'Andrade , and it is believed that the remnant wild herds of the breed died out soon after . These horses were kept in a habitat similar to their native one . In 1975 , two other farms took up the Sorraia 's cause and acquired small herds to help with conservation . In 1976 , three stallions and three mares were imported to Germany from Portugal to begin a sub - population there . In March 2004 , a small breeding herd of Sorraia horses was released on the estate of a private land owner who dedicated a portion of his property so that these horses could live completely wild , as did their ancestors . The refuge created for them is in the Vale de Zebro region of south western Portugal , one of places so named because this is where the Sorraia 's predecessors dwelt .

Statements about the Qedarites in the annals of the Assyrian kings of Ashurbanipal and his son Esarhaddon indicate that the term Kedar was almost synonymous with Arabia . Hazael , who ruled c . 690 676 BCE , is described as a Qedarite king by Ashurbanipal and king of the Arabs by Esarhaddon . After Sennacherib 's invasion of Babylonia in 691 689 BCE , Hazael fled to Dumah . Dumah is referred to as Adummatu by the Assyrians , and the city is described by them as the seat of the Qedar confederation and the base of their cult .

From 3 June to 30 September 1960 , Braathens SAFE was granted concession on the route from Oslo via Sandefjord Airport , Torp to Aalborg Airport in Denmark . This became possible because SAS had abandoned the route the previous year . It was flown with a DC - 3 , giving an 80 load factor . On 22 July , the Braathens SAFE applied for a three - year concession , but this was rejected because SAS stated that they would restart the route . In 1961 , SAS started the route Stavanger Kristiansand lborg , and in 1963 on the route Oslo Kristiansand lborg . The concession allowed SAS to also take passengers on the domestic legs , giving Braathens SAFE competition on the routes to Kristiansand .

Hed PE left Jive Records , releasing their fourth studio album , Only in Amerika , on Koch Records on October 19 , 2004 . It peaked at No. 20 on the Top Independent Albums chart and at No. 186 on the Billboard 200 . In his review of the album , Johnny Loftus wrote It wants to be a confrontational megaphone in the ear of conservatives , but Jahred 's torrential rhetoric is too messy and blatantly offensive to incite anything but superficial anger , and the music -- though occasionally explosive -- takes a backseat to the ranting . 
He was also played by Giuliano Gemma in the 1964 film Revolt of the Praetorians .
Although they had lost contact during the night , the Americans did find the Japanese carriers at 07 : 35 . They had already launched an airstrike of 180 aircraft that was orbiting 50 miles 80 km ahead of the American carriers while waiting for the Japanese ships to be located . This was just the first of a total of five airstrikes that the Americans launched that day . The sisters were not heavily engaged by the early airstrikes which are focusing on the group 's aircraft carriers .

Florida Atlantic University and the University of Miami 's Miller School of Medicine established a medical training program within the Charles E. Schmidt College of Biomedical Science in 2004 . Plans originally called for the construction of a new teaching hospital in coordination with Boca Raton Community Hospital on the main campus . Following successive budgets deficits in 2007 , the hospital delayed its participation indefinitely . However , Florida Atlantic later established its own College of Medicine in 2010 . The Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution HBOI also joined the university in 2007 , creating Florida Atlantic 's seventh campus . To bring HBOI into the university family the Florida Legislature allocated 44 million to Florida Atlantic to acquire the institution .
The ships were designed to carry fourteen 15 cm 5 . 9 in SK L 45 guns , mounted in casemates along the superstructure . Because Derfflinger had to be fitted with anti - roll tanks , two of the casemated guns had to be removed , to allow enough room in the hull . L tzow and Hindenburg were equipped with the designed number of guns . Each gun was supplied with 160 rounds , and had a maximum range of 13 , 500 m 14 , 800 yd , though this was later extended to 16 , 800 m 18 , 400 yd . The guns had a sustained rate of fire of five to seven rounds per minute . The shells were 45 . 3 kg 99 . 8 lb , and were loaded with a 13 . 7 kg 31 . 2 lb RPC 12 propellant charge in a brass cartridge . The guns fired at a muzzle velocity of 835 meters per second 2 , 740 ft s . The guns were expected to fire around 1 , 400 shells before they needed to be replaced .

He then went to the United States to earn a master 's degree in the School of Cinematic Arts at the University of Southern California . Chen studied in the Interactive Media Program , a new division of the School of Cinematic Arts . His intention at the time was to use the degree to get the kind of job he wanted back in China . At USC , he became inspired when he went to the Game Developers Conference , where he positively compared the games he had made in college with the student work present at the Independent Games Festival portion of the conference . While at USC he met Kellee Santiago , another student in the same program , and the two decided to work together on games that would be outside of the mainstream . Their first game , which won a grant of twenty thousand dollars from USC to produce , was Cloud , released in 2005 , which focuses on a young hospital patient who soars in his mind despite being trapped indoors . The idea was partially based on himself , as when he was a child he was often hospitalized for asthma . It was designed as an attempt to expand the spectrum of emotions video games evoke . At a student showcase at the Game Developers Conference , Chen and Santiago showed the game to a representative from Sony , John Hight , saying that it was the first game in the Zen genre . Hight was interested , though no deal was forthcoming . The game won the Best Student Philosophy award at the Slamdance Guerilla Games Competition and a Student Showcase award at the Independent Games Festival , and was showcased on Spike TV , G4TV , and CBS Sunday .
During the group stages of their campaign , Somerset achieved a number of large victories . They won by eight wickets against Warwickshire and Middlesex , and by more than a hundred runs against Kent and Scotland .

Somerset were set a reduced target of 290 off 41 overs , of which 19 were allocated by the umpires as being powerplay overs , three more than there should have been . The England and Wales Cricket Board ECB rejected Middlesex 's request to replay the match , stating that they were upholding the precedent that umpire errors cannot form the basis to declare a match null and void .

More positively , Nelson Bocaranda , a Venezuelan TV commentator , considers the novel to be a tonic for Latin American culture : people here saw a Bol var who is a man of flesh and bones just like themselves . Mexican author Carlos Fuentes agrees with Bocaranda saying : What comes across beautifully and poignantly in this book is a man dealing with the unknown world of democratic ideas . Garc a M rquez realistically portrays a ridiculous figure trapped in a labyrinth , magnifying the General 's defects , and presenting an image of Bol var contrary to that instilled in classrooms . However , the novel also depicts Bol var as an idealist and political theorist who predicted many problems that would obstruct Latin American advancement in the future . Garc a M rquez depicts a figure who was aware of the racial and social friction in Latin American society , feared debt , and warned against economic irresponsibility . He has the General warn his aide - de - camp , Agust n de Iturbide , against the future interference of the United States in the internal affairs of Latin America .

Character names were also localized to use double meanings similarly to the Japanese names ; the name puns were based on the characters ' personalities or backgrounds , or were visual gags . Several English names were based on their Japanese counterparts , but for some characters the names had to be altered heavily compared to the Japanese versions . Smith and Anderson had a lot of freedom when localizing the names of minor characters in the first game , but discussed the names of the main cast with Capcom . Phoenix 's English surname , Wright , was chosen as his Japanese name , Naruhod meaning I see or I understand was frequently used as a joke in the script .
Although several communities across the United States claim to have inspired Trees , nothing can be established specifically regarding Kilmer 's inspiration except that he wrote the poem while residing in Mahwah . Both Kilmer 's widow , Aline , and his son , Kenton , refuted these claims in their correspondence with researchers and by Kenton in his memoir . Kenton wrote to University of Notre Dame researcher Dorothy Colson :
Bramatyo cast his wife , Zaskia Adya Mecca , as Ahmad Dahlan 's wife Siti Walidah Mecca also served as casting director , in charge of auditioning the supporting cast . Before filming began , Mecca attempted to research the biographies of Dahlan and his wife , as she and the other young actors did not know much about the couple .

A star 's life begins with the gravitational collapse of a gaseous nebula of material composed primarily of hydrogen , along with helium and trace amounts of heavier elements . When the stellar core is sufficiently dense , hydrogen becomes steadily converted into helium through nuclear fusion , releasing energy in the process . The remainder of the star 's interior carries energy away from the core through a combination of radiative and convective heat transfer processes . The star 's internal pressure prevents it from collapsing further under its own gravity . When the hydrogen fuel at the core is exhausted , a star of mass 0 . 4 times greater than the Sun 's will expand to become a red giant . In some cases , it will fuse heavier elements at the core or in shells around the core . As the star expands it throws a part of its mass , enriched with those heavier elements , into the interstellar environment , to be recycled later as new stars . Meanwhile , the core becomes a stellar remnant : a white dwarf , a neutron star , or if it is sufficiently massive a black hole .

The Threefoot Preservation Society was formed in 2013 to raise public awareness and support for the building 's renovation , featuring tours of the first floor and anniversary events .
Therefrom emerged a film treatment called The Message . The original script had more of a police procedural approach , with the alien being created by a bathtub geneticist who had just had his project aborted by the government , and a biologist who had worked on the project getting along with a police officer to search for the creature . Eventually Feldman came to believe this concept had some credibility issues , and instead changed the protagonists to a government team . After coining the name Sil , Feldman initially thought of forming an acronym , but in the end chose only the three - letter name after learning about the codons of the genetic code , which can be represented in groups of three letters . Sil would originally emerge from a DNA sequence manipulating human DNA , and constantly mutate as she used the human junk DNA to access all the defenses of the entire animal kingdom that humans evolved through including ones that had never developed , plus ones Earth 's scientists don 't know about that have become extinct . Among the research Feldman did for the script included going to sessions of UCLA 's Center for the Study of Evolution and the Origin of Life CSEOL , talking to SETI scientists , and visiting the Salk Institute for Biological Studies to talk with researchers working on the Human Genome Project . The Message was offered to several studios , but was passed up .
Once signed up , each man was instructed to travel to Switzerland , where appropriate visas were swiftly procured from the South African Embassy . In early November 1977 , the French recruits flew from Zurich to Johannesburg on a South African Airways liner , then to Salisbury by Air Rhodesia . Already in Rhodesia waiting for the men were their leaders : Major Roland de l 'Assomption , an ex - officer of the French Army 's crack 11th Shock Parachute Regiment , and a former officer of the Gabonese President Omar Bongo 's guard ; and Major Mario La Viola , once a non - commissioned officer in the Foreign Legion 's 2nd Parachute Regiment . Beneath them were the Antillean Captain Toumi , who became the first black officer in the regular Rhodesian Army as the unit 's second - in - command , and Colonel Bob Denard , an infamous French soldier of fortune nicknamed le chien de guerre the dog of war .
The 9th Parachute Battalion , part of the 3rd Parachute Brigade attached to 6th Airborne Division , was given the objective of destroying the battery . However , when the battalion arrived over Normandy , their parachute descent was dispersed over a large area , so instead of over 600 men , only 150 with no heavy weapons or equipment arrived at the battalion assembly point . Regardless , they pressed home their attack and succeeded in capturing the battery , only to discover that the guns were of a lower caliber than expected Czech - manufacture 100mm . However , these still had the range over 8000 metres to hit targets on Sword Beach and in Ouistreham . Using what explosives they had been able to recover , the surviving 75 men tried to disable the guns .
 Ode to a Nightingale was probably the first of the middle set of four odes that Keats wrote following Ode to Psyche , according to Brown . There is further evidence of this in the structure of the poems because Keats combines two different types of lyrical poetry in an experimental way : the odal hymn and the lyric of questioning voice that responds to the odal hymn . This combination of structures is similar to that in Ode on a Grecian Urn . In both poems the dual form creates a sort of dramatic element within the poem . The stanza forms of the poem is a combination of elements from Petrarchan sonnets and Shakespearean sonnets .
Newman and Copland led the charge from the old town across a bridge raked by machine gun fire and advanced into the new town .

The series was created by Shu Takumi , who wrote and directed the first three games . The first game was conceived in 2000 when Takumi 's boss at the time , Shinji Mikami , gave him six months to create any type of game he wanted to ; Takumi had originally joined Capcom wanting to make mystery and adventure games , and felt that this was a big chance for him to make a mark as a creator . The game was designed to be simple , as Takumi wanted it to be easy enough for even his mother to play . It was originally going to be a detective game , with Phoenix being a private investigator , but at one point Takumi realized that finding and taking apart contradictions was not related to detective work , and felt that the main setting of the game should be courtrooms .
Rossen filmed The Hustler over six weeks , entirely in New York City . Much of the action was filmed at two now - defunct pool halls , McGirr 's and Ames Billiard Academy . Other shooting locations included a townhouse on East 82nd Street , which served as the Louisville home of Murray Hamilton 's character Findley , and the Manhattan Greyhound bus terminal . The film crew built a dining area that was so realistic that confused passengers sat there and waited to place their orders . Willie Mosconi served as technical advisor on the film and shot a number of the trick shots in place of the actors . All of Gleason 's shots were his own ; they were filmed in wide - angle to emphasize having the actor and the shot in the same frames . Rossen , in pursuit of the style he termed neo - neo - realistic , hired actual street thugs , enrolled them in the Screen Actors Guild and used them as extras . Scenes that were included in the shooting script but did not make it into the final film include a scene at Ames pool hall establishing that Eddie is on his way to town originally slated to be the first scene of the film and a longer scene of Preacher talking to Bert at Johnny 's Bar which establishes Preacher is a junkie .

The conquest of Adummatu by Sennacherib in 690 BCE and the capture of a Qedarite queen , Te 'elkhunu , who was brought back to Assyria with other loot , including divine images , is also mentioned in the annals of the Assyrian monarchs . Esarhaddon eventually returned the renewed images of the Arab gods to Adummatu with Tabua , who grew up in the palace of Sennacherib , and was appointed Qedarite queen by Esarhaddon to replace Te 'elkhunu . However , strained relations between the Assyrians and the Qedarites meant that she ruled for only a brief period , with Esarhaddon recognizing Hazael as the king of Qedar after he increased his tribute to the Assyrian monarch by 65 camels . Esarhaddon then appointed Yauta , son of Hazael , as a Qedarite king , following Hazael 's death . That Yauta paid a tribute in the form of 10 minas of gold , 1 , 000 precious stones , 50 camels , and 1 , 000 leather pouches of aromatics is also recorded .

In comparing Olivier and the other leading actors of his generation , Ustinov wrote , It is of course vain to talk of who is and who is not the greatest actor . There is simply no such thing as a greatest actor , or painter or composer . Nonetheless , some colleagues , particularly film actors such as Spencer Tracy , Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall , came to regard Olivier as the finest of his peers . Peter Hall , though acknowledging Olivier as the head of the theatrical profession , thought Richardson the greater actor . Others , such as the critic Michael Coveney , awarded the palm to Gielgud . Olivier 's claim to theatrical greatness lay not only in his acting , but as , in Hall 's words , the supreme man of the theatre of our time , pioneering Britain 's National Theatre . As Bragg identified , no one doubts that the National is perhaps his most enduring monument .
Like the other specialized archipelago vessels , the hemmema had specific strengths and weaknesses . Although it had superior firepower relative to galleys , its sailing qualities were somewhat mediocre and while highly manoeuvrable under oars , it was still difficult to propel while rowed . A hemmema had the potential to be an effective weapon against galleys , matching their forward firepower and severely outgunning them with its broadside armament . Inside an enemy galley formation , it could wreak considerable havoc , but such a maneuver was never achieved in an actual battle , leaving that tactical role untested .
Artificial intelligence is based on the assumption that the process of human thought can be mechanized . The study of mechanical or formal reasoning has a long history . Chinese , Indian and Greek philosophers all developed structured methods of formal deduction in the first millennium BCE . Their ideas were developed over the centuries by philosophers such as Aristotle who gave a formal analysis of the syllogism , Euclid whose Elements was a model of formal reasoning , Muslim mathematician al - Khw rizm who developed algebra and gave his name to algorithm and European scholastic philosophers such as William of Ockham and Duns Scotus .

I grew up ... discontented , ugly , abnormally sensitive , and excessively conceited . No one liked me not masters , boys , friends of the family , nor relations who came to stay ; and I do not in the least wonder at it . I was untidy , uncleanly , excessively gauche . I believed that I was profoundly misunderstood , that people took my pale and pimpled countenance for the mirror of my soul , that I had marvellous things of interest in me that would one day be discovered .

In their native lands , mole crickets have natural enemies that keep them under control . This is not the case when they have been accidentally introduced to other parts of the world . In Florida they are considered pests and are described as a serious problem . A University of Florida Entomology report suggests that South American Neoscapteriscus mole crickets may have entered the United States at Brunswick , Georgia in ship 's ballast from southern South America around 1899 , but were at that time mistakenly believed to be from the West Indies . One possible remedy is biological pest control using the parasitoidal wasps Larra bicolor . Another remedy that has been successfully applied is use of the parasitic nematode Steinernema scapterisci . When this is applied in strips across grassland , it spreads throughout the pasture within a few months and not only controls the mole crickets , but remains infective in the soil for future years .

The host spectrum of the Amylostereaceae comprises several , partially very different genera of Coniferae . A. chailletii usually infests Pinaceae such as firs Abies and spruces Picea , but also cedars Cedrus and Douglas firs Pseudotsuga . A. areolatum has a similar host spectrum , which uses mainly firs , Japanese cedars Cryptomeria , larches Larix , spruces , pines Pinus and Douglas firs as hosts . While spruces dominate as hosts in the native habitat , this species is more common in pines on other locations . The host spectrum of A. laevigatum comprises Cupressaceae such as junipers Juniperus or cypresses Cupressus and the English yew Taxus baccata . A. ferreum is , however , only common on neotropic yellowwoods Podocarpus .

After completing his excavation of the Carlaeon amphitheatre in 1928 , he began fieldwork at the Roman settlement and temple in Lydney Park , Gloucestershire , having been invited to do so by the aristocratic landowner , Charles Bathurst . It was during these investigations that Wheeler personally discovered the Lydney Hoard of coinage . Wheeler and his wife jointly published their excavation report in 1932 as Report on the Excavation of the Prehistoric , Roman and Post - Roman Site in Lydney Park , Gloucestershire , which Piggott noted had set the pattern for all Wheeler 's future excavation reports .
Fowler began the 2001 02 season controversially , after being dropped by the then manager G rard Houllier from the Liverpool squad for the 2001 Charity Shield match following a training ground confrontation with assistant manager Phil Thompson . He made an appearance in Liverpool 's 3 2 European Super Cup victory over Bayern Munich , but starts were intermittent . In October 2001 , he scored his first league hat - trick for three years , helping Liverpool beat Leicester City 4 1 , but was dropped for the following league match . Though Fowler had been on a contract extension from 1999 unlike Steve McManaman who exercised his Bosman entitlement the very same year , Fowler was linked to Lazio , Arsenal and Leeds , and Liverpool 's management as well as fans and the media constantly reported that what happened with McManaman regarded as a huge financial loss would never be repeated and thus the club never rejected those bids without consideration . This meant that coupled with Fowler 's relationship with Houllier , speculation over Fowler 's future persisted for most of Houllier 's tenure and became an issue that divided Liverpool fans . His last appearance for Liverpool was against Sunderland , in which he was substituted at half - time .

Two realignments in 1963 and 1964 rerouted the western end of the highway again . This time it was realigned to run from Hesperia to New Era , bypassing Ferry . A larger change around 1969 reconfigured the highway designations in Oceana County . M - 20 replaced M - 82 west of Hesperia , to end at New Era instead of Muskegon . The new M - 120 designation replaced M - 20 south of Hesperia . M - 82 now ran from Hesperia to Newaygo only . The length of the highway was increased in 1973 when the eastern end was moved back to Howard City . M - 46 was rerouted to follow the US 131 freeway south of Howard City to Cedar Springs , and replaced M - 57 between Cedar Springs and Casnovia . This freed up the Newaygo to Howard City highway for a return to the M - 82 designation . The last change came in 1978 when the concurrency with M - 120 was eliminated in favor of M - 120 . The M - 82 designation was truncated at this time to the junction west of Fremont , resulting in the current highway routing .
Pope Innocent proclaimed the Fifth Crusade in 1213 , with the liberation of the Holy Land the reconquest of Jerusalem its principal object . The first crusader troops , commanded by Leopold VI of Austria , landed at Acre in early September 1217 . Andrew II of Hungary and his army followed that month , and Hugh I of Cyprus and Bohemond IV of Antioch soon joined the crusaders . However , hundreds of crusaders soon returned to Europe because of a famine following the previous year 's poor harvest . A war council was held in the tent of Andrew II , who considered himself the supreme commander of the crusader army . Other leaders , particularly John , did not acknowledge Andrew 's leadership .

With casualties mounting and pressure being placed on the brigade 's rear due to a large gap that had developed around Kranji , by the Japanese advances in the 22nd Infantry Brigade 's area , the decision was made to withdraw from the beach and realign north south along the Woodlands Road . Further south , the Australian 22nd and Indian 44th , 6th 15th and 12th Infantry Brigades also established themselves along this axis between Bukit Panjang and Pasir Panjang on the south coast and by early evening on 10 February the Japanese had secured the entire west coast of the island .
The American government demonstrated no knowledge of Per n 's deep admiration for Italy and his distaste for Germany , whose culture he found too rigid . Nor did they appreciate that although anti - Semitism existed in Argentina , Per n 's own views and his political associations were not anti - Semitic . They paid no attention to the fact that Per n sought out the Jewish community in Argentina to assist in developing his policies and that one of his most important allies in organizing the industrial sector was Jos Ber Gelbard , a Jewish immigrant from Poland .

Harold Innis 's analysis of the effects of communications on the rise and fall of empires led him to warn grimly that Western civilization was now facing its own profound crisis . The development of powerful communications media such as mass - circulation newspapers had shifted the balance decisively in favour of space and power , over time , continuity and knowledge . The balance required for cultural survival had been upset by what Innis saw as mechanized communications media used to transmit information quickly over long distances . These media had contributed to an obsession with present - mindedness wiping out concerns about past or future . Innis wrote ,
Jonathan Rowson has speculated that in principle it should be possible for a machine to ... develop 32 - piece tablebases . This may take decades or even centuries , but unless runaway global warming or nuclear war gets in the way , I think it will eventually happen . However , information theorist Claude Shannon argued that it is not feasible for any computer to actually do this . In his 1950 paper Programming a Computer for Playing Chess he writes :
Among his Maryland teammates and coaches , Turner earned a reputation as an archetypal laid - back Californian and for remaining calm under pressure .

Modern writers also argue that Black has certain countervailing advantages . The consensus that White should try to win can be a psychological burden for the white player , who sometimes loses by trying too hard to win . Some symmetrical openings i.e. those where both players make the same moves can lead to situations where moving first is a disadvantage , either for psychological or objective reasons .

Given that Gibraltar was a small town with only a few defences protecting it , the solution was to build a massive series of tunnels and chambers inside the natural protection of the Rock of Gibraltar . This town inside the Rock contained its own power station , water supply , and hospital . Some soldiers posted here would not see the light of day for months on end . Two Canadian engineer companies , the only soldiers with diamond - tipped drills and 5 British engineer companies , added some 30 miles 48 km of such tunnels , a feat thought impossible at the time . That was enough to hold all 30 , 000 troops on the rock . Today , the rock has more underground tunnels than roads .

Despite the funny aspect of the script Hughes took the role seriously stating that everyone plays it for real and that you can 't camp it up . She believed that as an actor you 've got to believe what you 're doing .
Ahead of the election , the Rio de Janeiro bid committee lodged an official complaint against Madrid with the IOC Ethics Commission about comments made on September 30 , 2009 , by Jos Maria Odriozola , vice president of the Spanish Olympic Committee SOC ; and considered doing it against Chicago due to comments by Richard M. Daley , Mayor of Chicago , on September 21 , 2009 . Odriozola called Rio de Janeiro the worst of the four candidates , while Rio officials believe that Daley implied that the city was incapable of hosting the Olympics when he said it was not the same as hosting the 2014 FIFA World Cup . Mercedes Coghen apologised for Odriozola 's comments on behalf of the Madrid bid committee . According to the IOC rules , rival cities are not allowed to directly criticise other bidders . After the conclusion of the bid process , Shintar Ishihara , Governor of Tokyo , blamed invisible dynamics and political deals for Tokyo 's failure . Rio officials repudiated the inappropriate statements and sent a formal notification to the IOC on October 6 , 2009 .

The increasing violence in Derry and elsewhere led to increasing speculation that internment without trial would be introduced in Northern Ireland , and on 9 August 1971 hundreds of republicans and nationalists were arrested in dawn raids . In Derry , residents came out onto the streets to resist the arrests , and fewer people were taken there than elsewhere ; nevertheless leading figures including Se n Keenan and Johnnie White were interned . In response , barricades were erected once again and the third Free Derry came into existence . Unlike its predecessors , this Free Derry was marked by a strong IRA presence , both Official and Provisional . It was defended by armed paramilitaries a no - go area , one in which British security forces were unable to operate .
In 2005 , Constantine was released , a feature film that did not use the same title as the comic book , in order to avoid confusion with the Hellraiser horror franchise . The only links to the character of John Constantine were the name and a plotline loosely based on the Dangerous Habits story arc Hellblazer 41 46 . DC Comics announced a sequel to the 2005 Constantine movie was in the works , with producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura linked to the project . He stated : I 'd love to do it ... We want to do a hard , R - rated version of it . We 're going to scale back the size of the movie to try and persuade the studio to go ahead and make a tough version of it .

Bedell would later join other House Democrats in demanding documents from the White House related to the contras , but the Reagan Administration refused to provide them . Bedell became angrier with the Reagan Administration as the decade wore on . He called his Central American policies sheer lunacy , saying that the mining of harbors was an acts of war . Bedell would retire from Congress before Reagan 's acts in Central America would culminate with the Iran - Contra Affair .

Causes of death in the wild include disability and disease , competition with other cougars , starvation , accidents , and , where allowed , human hunting . Feline immunodeficiency virus , an endemic HIV - like virus in cats , is well - adapted to the cougar .

She was by any standard a very extraordinary woman ; when you think of Argentina and indeed Latin America as a men dominated part of the world , there was this woman who was playing a very great role . And of course she aroused very different feelings in the people with whom she lived . The oligarchs , as she called the well - to - do and privileged people , hated her . They looked upon her as a ruthless woman . The masses of the people on the other hand worshipped her . They looked upon her as a lady bountiful who was dispensing Manna from heaven .

Although not a government holiday , the anniversary of Eva Per n 's death is marked by many Argentines each year . Additionally , Eva Per n has been featured on Argentine coins , and a form of Argentine currency called Evitas was named in her honor . Ciudad Evita Evita City , which was established by the Eva Per n Foundation in 1947 , is located just outside Buenos Aires .
In the early 20th century , some printers began using one and a half interword spaces an en quad to separate sentences . This standard continued in use , to some extent , into the 1990s .
International rescue efforts were restricted by traffic congestion and blocked roads . Although US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates had previously ruled out dropping food and water by air as too dangerous , by 16 January , US helicopters were distributing aid to areas impossible to reach by land .
Carey started writing songs for the album in early 2002 , before she signed the record deal . She decided to rest , traveled to Capri and moved into a recording studio where she could focus on writing and recording without distractions . Most of the album was recorded in Capri , although she traveled to Atlanta , New York and Philadelphia to record some tracks . That year , Carey claimed Charmbracelet to be the most personal album she had ever made . She worked with longtime collaborators Jermaine Dupri , Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and Randy Jackson and other songwriters and producers 7 Aurelius , Just Blaze , Damizza and Dre Vidal . The opening track and the first track to be written for the album , Through the Rain , was written by Carey and Lionel Cole , was inspired Carey 's recent experiences , and was co - produced by Jam and Lewis . It was released as the lead single from the album .

The Yankees sought to develop their own players , rather than buying them from other teams , especially after the investment of 100 , 000 1 , 362 , 261 in current dollar terms in Lyn Lary and Jimmie Reese in 1927 . However , Weiss and Bill Essick convinced Barrow to approve the purchase of Joe DiMaggio from the Pacific Coast League .
The west coast of Ireland , Lahinch and Donegal Bay in particular , have popular surfing beaches , being fully exposed to the Atlantic Ocean . Donegal Bay is shaped like a funnel and catches west south - west Atlantic winds , creating good surf , especially in winter . Since just before the year 2010 , Bundoran has hosted European championship surfing . Scuba diving is increasingly popular in Ireland with clear waters and large populations of sea life , particularly along the western seaboard . There are also many shipwrecks along the coast of Ireland , with some of the best wreck dives being in Malin Head and off the County Cork coast .
 Joyful , Joyful , is a rearrangement of the hymn Joyful , Joyful We Adore Thee itself a re - arrangement of a theme from Beethoven . Hall felt that there are many Christian songs that have been around and sung so long that the meaning behind them is lost ; he commented that you hear them so many times you don 't really hear what they 're saying anymore , listing the original version of Joyful , Joyful We Adore Thee as an example .
The chief executive , Brian McMaster , did not appoint a replacement to Geliot as principal director during the 1980s , preferring to engage guest producers . Boyd mentions Andrei erban 's Eugene Onegin 1980 among the successes and Lucian Pintilie 's Carmen 1983 and Ruth Berghaus 's Don Giovanni 1984 as productions that received more mixed responses . Sir Charles Mackerras , the conductor for Don Giovanni , was open in his contempt for Berghaus 's production . Harry Kupfer 's Fidelio 1981 was condemned by The Daily Telegraph as a piece of Marxist polemic making political sport of Beethoven 's work . McMaster was thought by some too inclined to favour radical eastern European directors : Jonathan Miller , a leading English director , commented that he did not intend to take Bulgarian nationality , although it was a must before Brian pays any attention .
 Fort Glanville Conservation Park 
Square - shaped Fort Sullivan consisted only of the completed seaward wall , with walls made from palmetto logs 20 feet 6 . 1 m high and 16 feet 4 . 9 m wide . The walls were filled with sand , and rose 10 feet 3 . 0 m above the wooden platforms on which the artillery were mounted . A hastily erected palisade of thick planks helped guard the powder magazine and unfinished northern walls . An assortment of 31 cannon , ranging from 9- and 12 - pounders to a few British 18 - pounders and French 26 - pounders , dotted the front and rear walls . General Lee , when he had seen its unfinished state , had recommended abandoning the fort , calling it a slaughter pen . President Rutledge refused , and specifically ordered Colonel Moultrie to obey Lee in everything , except in leaving Fort Sullivan . Moultrie 's delaying tactics so angered Lee that he decided on June 27 that he would replace Moultrie ; the battle began the next day before he could do so . Lee did make plans for an orderly retreat to Haddrell 's Point .
We know more about Lancaster 's character than of most of his contemporaries through his memoirs , the Livre de seyntz medicines Book of the Holy Doctors . This book is a highly personal treatise on matters of religion and piety , but it also contains details of historical interest . It , among other things , revealed that Lancaster , at the age of 44 when he wrote the book in 1354 , suffered from gout . The book is primarily a devotional work though ; it is organized around seven wounds which Henry claims to have , representing the seven sins . Lancaster confesses to his sins , explains various real and mythical medical remedies in terms of their theological symbolism , and exhorts the reader to greater morality .
The Island Def Jam rapper Big K.R.I.T. was born in Meridian . K.R.I.T is known for his many mixtapes and albums such as K.R.I.T. Wuz Here and Cadillactica . He has gained a large following for his lyricism and self - produced beats as well as his ability to change his style on songs from slow and conscious tracks The Vent to fiery and upbeat tracks Mt . Olympus .
Mathews and an escort force went to Witu where , on 31 July , they removed the flag of the IBEA company and replaced it with the red flag of Zanzibar , before destroying several villages and causing Oman to retreat into the forests . The British troops then withdrew , having suffered heavily from malaria , but the Sudanese and Zanzibari troops remained . A further expedition was sent of 140 sailors and 85 other troops but Oman died soon after and a more pliable sultan , Omar bin Hamid , was appointed to govern on behalf of Zanzibar , bringing the affair to a close . In return for this action , Mathews received the British East and West Africa campaign medal .
L grimas C lidas English : Warm Tears is the debut studio album by Colombian recording artist Fanny Lu , released on January 1 , 2005 .

Gore invested his fortune in a variety of businesses , including important infrastructure projects such as the Middlesex Canal and a bridge across the Charles River . He was a major investor in the early textile industry , funding the Boston Manufacturing Company and the Merrimack Manufacturing Company , whose business established the city of Lowell , Massachusetts . Gore was involved in a variety of charitable causes , and was a major benefactor of Harvard College , where the first library was named in his honor . His palatial mansion in Waltham , Massachusetts , now known as Gore Place , is one of the finest extant examples of Federalist architecture , and has been declared a National Historic Landmark .
During his Dinkytown days , Zimmerman began introducing himself as Bob Dylan . In his memoir , Dylan acknowledged that he had been influenced by the poetry of Dylan Thomas . Explaining his change of name in a 2004 interview , Dylan remarked , You 're born , you know , the wrong names , wrong parents . I mean , that happens . You call yourself what you want to call yourself . This is the land of the free . 
Teamed with his nephews Huey , Dewey , and Louie , and using the partial map from the library , Donald begins his search in Duckburg , with the trail being directed to an Aztec pyramid in Mexico . Outside the pyramid , he is directed by a sweet seniorita to obtain a hero key from an explorer back in Duckburg to open the pyramid . Inside the pyramid , Donald meets Goofy , who gives him a strange note and a plunger to help him reach higher places , and tells him that Gyro Gearloose is looking for him back in Duckburg . Travelling across the rooftops of Duckburg to meet Gyro , Donald is given Gyro 's latest invention , bubblegum ammo that can break through walls . The last location on the partial map is Count Dracula 's castle in Transylvania , where Donald encounters a ghost who tells him that the Count carries the real treasure map .
Between July 1984 and March 1985 , Dylan recorded Empire Burlesque . Arthur Baker , who had remixed hits for Bruce Springsteen and Cyndi Lauper , was asked to engineer and mix the album . Baker said he felt he was hired to make Dylan 's album sound a little bit more contemporary .
In a departure from most visual novels the player can also see , at any time , the equivalent of texts and Facebook postings between the students on a school social network called AmieConnect often shortened to Amie , as well as conversation threads on a 4chan - like imageboard that serve as foreshadowing for future plot points . These extra conversations take place in parallel to in - person conversations between characters , occasionally at the same time ; the player is notified anytime a new text message or post is made . A single playthrough of the game takes over an hour .
In recognition of the resemblance of the teeth to those of the iguana , Mantell decided to name his new animal Iguanodon or iguana - tooth , from iguana and the Greek word odon , odontos or tooth . Based on isometric scaling , he estimated that the creature might have been up to 18 metres 59 feet long , more than the 12 metres 39 feet length of Megalosaurus . His initial idea for a name was Iguana - saurus Iguana lizard , but his friend William Daniel Conybeare suggested that that name was more applicable to the iguana itself , so a better name would be Iguanoides Iguana - like or Iguanodon . He neglected to add a specific name to form a proper binomial , but one was supplied in 1829 by Friedrich Holl : I. anglicum , which was later amended to I. anglicus .
Regarded throughout his playing career as one of the best defenders in hockey , Ross was named to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1949 , selected for his playing career rather than his work as an executive . A ceremony for his induction was held prior to a Bruins game on December 2 , 1949 , where he was given his Hall of Fame scroll and a silver tray with the emblems of the six NHL teams on it . In 1975 he was inducted into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame . Along with his two sons he donated the Art Ross Trophy to the NHL in 1947 , to be awarded to the leading scorer in the league 's regular season . In 1984 he was posthumously awarded the Lester Patrick Trophy for service to hockey in the United States .
In 1842 , Fort Scott was named after Winfield Scott , was established on the American frontier on the military road in eastern Kansas between Fort Leavenworth and Fort Gibson . It was established to provide protection to the rapidly increasing number of settlers , who were migrating from the Eastern United States . Fort Scott became one of a chain of forts intended to protect the new settlers from the Plains Indians , as well as to protect the Indians from the settlers ' encroachment .
The cephalothorax of Z. sexpunctatus is bronze to black in color . Like all Zygoballus spiders , the cephalothorax is box - like in shape , being widest at the posterior lateral eyes . Numerous white or pale blue scales cover the clypeus face and chelicerae . This covering extends around the sides of the carapace , ending beyond the posterior median eyes . In males , the labium is two - fifths as long as the maxillae , and as wide as it is long . The chelicerae of males are greatly enlarged and obliquely oriented , with each chelicera having a prominent inner tooth and a long , curved fang .
In a retrospective review , Jeuxvideo.com had high praise for the level design , graphics , and animations . They also found the music excellent in comparison to the annoying and repetitive soundtrack of most Breakout clones . The magazine also liked how the game fit the Kirby universe , apart from its increased difficulty Jeuxvideo.com occasionally had trouble hitting the slow - paced ball with precision .
She was armed with a main battery of four 13 in 330 mm 35 caliber guns guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline , one forward and aft . The secondary battery consisted of fourteen 6 in 152 mm 40 caliber Mark IV guns , which were placed in casemates in the hull . For close - range defense against torpedo boats , she carried sixteen 6 - pounder guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull and six 1 - pounder guns . As was standard for capital ships of the period , Illinois carried four 18 in 457 mm torpedo tubes in deck mounted launchers .
After slightly weakening throughout the day on August 6 , Felicia leveled out with winds of 135 mph 215 km h and a 23 mi 37 km wide eye as the storm developed characteristics of an annular hurricane , which would allow Felicia to maintain a high intensity over marginally warm waters . Early the next day , the structure of the hurricane quickly deteriorated as convection became asymmetric and cloud tops warmed significantly . This marked a quick drop in intensity of the storm to a minimal Category 3 hurricane . Several hours later , the mid - level circulation began to separate from the low - level circulation and the overall size of the storm decreased . By this time , the storm began to take a long - anticipated westward turn towards Hawaii . After briefly re - intensifying on August 7 , Felicia weakened to a Category 1 hurricane early on August 8 . Around 11 : 00 am HST 2100 UTC , the Central Pacific Hurricane Center CPHC took over responsibility of issuing advisories as Felicia crossed longitude 140 W.
The most significant benefit of the use of the technique is that it has provided a more complete history of tropical cyclone intensity in areas where aircraft reconnaissance is neither possible nor routinely available . Intensity estimates of maximum sustained wind are currently within 5 miles per hour 8 . 0 km h of what aircraft are able to measure half of the time , though the assignment of intensity of systems with strengths between moderate tropical - storm force 60 miles per hour 97 km h and weak hurricane- or typhoon - force 100 miles per hour 160 km h is the least certain . Its overall precision has not always been true , as refinements in the technique led to intensity changes between 1972 and 1977 of up to 20 miles per hour 32 km h . The method is internally consistent in that it constrains rapid increases or decreases in tropical cyclone intensity . Some tropical cyclones fluctuate in strength more than the 2 . 5 T numbers per day limit allowed by the rule , which can work to the technique 's disadvantage and has led to occasional abandonment of the constraints since the 1980s . Systems with small eyes near the limb , or edge , of a satellite image can be biased too weakly using the technique , which can be resolved through use of polar - orbiting satellite imagery . Subtropical cyclone intensity cannot be determined using Dvorak , which led to the development of the Hebert - Poteat technique in 1975 . Cyclones undergoing extratropical transition , losing their thunderstorm activity , see their intensities underestimated using the Dvorak technique . This led to the development of the Miller and Lander extratropical transition technique which can be used under these circumstances .
Busch was ravaged by disease , and for five months spent time painting and collecting folk tales , legends , songs , ballads , rhymes and fragments of regional superstitions . Busch 's biographer Joseph Kraus saw these collections as useful additions to folklore , as Busch noted the narrative background to tales and the idiosyncrasies of storytellers . Busch tried to release the collections , but as a publisher could not be found at the time they were issued after his death . During the Nazi era Busch was known as an ethnic seer .

Sovetsky Soyuz Russian : Soviet Union was formally laid down 15 July 1938 in Shipyard Nr. 189 Ordzhonikidze in Leningrad , although evidence suggests that construction actually began in January 1939 after her slipway was completed , the necessary cranes were in place , and working drawings had been completed . When the war began she was estimated to be 21 . 19 complete , with 15 , 818 metric tons 15 , 568 long tons of steel assembled on the slip . She was only lightly damaged by German air attacks and bombardments , and , as some material had been used during the Siege of Leningrad , she was estimated to be 19 . 5 complete after the end of the war . Some thought was given to completing her , but this was opposed as she was regarded as obsolete in light of the experience gained during the war . Stalin 's expressed desire to see one of the Project 23 - class ships completed only delayed the decision to scrap her ; this was ordered on 29 May 1948 and was well underway by April 1949 .
Fish describes the game 's changes during development as organic they tested different kinds of levels and replicated the types of in - game exploration that the team appreciated most . It came to adopt Metroidvania mechanics , with secret passages , warp gates , and cheat codes . Fish cited Myst as another touchstone and compared its open world , nonlinear narrative , and obtuse metapuzzles to Fez 's own alphabet , numeric system , and an almost unfairly hard to get second set of collectibles . Fish originally fought against having an in - game map because he wanted players to draft their own . After attempting to do so himself , he changed his mind . Fish later called the in - game map probably one of the weakest aspects of the game . Fish also fought against including the navigational assistant , Dot , but later felt that the addition was successful and a positive contribution to the game 's mythology . The fez itself , Fish described as an ancient symbol of understanding the third dimension . Fez had three different animators through its development : Paul Robertson of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World : The Game , who did the game 's animals and some of Gomez 's animations , Adam Saltsman of Canabalt , and Graham Lackey , who did some character animations .
The Medway long barrows all conformed to the same general design plan , and are all aligned on an east to west axis . Each had a stone chamber at the eastern end of the mound , and they each probably had a stone facade flanking the entrance . The chambers were constructed from sarsen , a dense , hard , and durable stone that occurs naturally throughout Kent , having formed out of silicified sand from the Eocene . Early Neolithic builders would have selected blocks from the local area , and then transported them to the site of the monument to be erected .
Fighting colonial wars in Portuguese colonies had absorbed forty - four percent of the overall Portuguese budget . This led to an obvious diversion of funds from necessary infrastructural developments in Portugal itself . This contributed to the growing unrest in the European nation . Portugal 's GDP growth during the colonial war period 1961 1974 , was strong and reached a 6 rate a percentual GDP growth which were not achieved in any other comparable period after 1974 .
Public opinion towards aviation generally is worsening , based on increasing environmental concerns relating to emissions and noise , and private flying has been criticised by respondents to a government consultation on aircraft noise as a frivolous or selfish activity . In terms of environmental complaints and enquiries made to the CAA that relate specifically to GA , noise is by far the most common subject . Half of the 2 , 000 noise complaints made annually to the CAA concern GA operations , most of which relate to aerobatics , helicopters using private sites , air balloon incidents , parachute dropping , and alleged low flying .

Because NC State received the ball to begin the game , Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the second half . Tech received NC State 's kickoff and returned it to the 10 - yard line , where the Hokie offense began work . Tech began working down the field , running the ball for short gains and throwing passes for longer gains . Tech picked up three first downs , then reached NC State territory on a pass to Donnelly . Once on the NC State side of the field , Tech picked up another first down , but Tech 's quarterback was sacked on third down for a loss , and the Hokies were forced to punt the ball away . The ball landed at the NC State 12 - yard line where the Wolfpack began a drive .
The treatment of this species by certain taxonomists well illustrates the pitfalls that lie in wait for those who worship at the shrine of ontogenic classification ... The only feature of those outlined in which the species differs from others of Geastrum is the somewhat primitive hymenium . In the developing plant the glebal cavities are separated by tramal plates so tenuous as to be overlooked by the uncritical worker . Each cavity is filled with basidia somewhat irregularly arranged in clusters like those of Scleroderma and not in the definite palisade of the species which have been studied . This difference disappears as maturity is reached , when plants resemble closely the fructification of any other member of the genus . The taxonomist is then unable to indicate any point of difference by which Astraeus may be separated from Geastrum , which indicates that the name should be discarded .
In response , and hoping to win wider support for his government , Montfort summoned a new parliament for 20 January 1265 which continued until mid March that year . It was held at short notice , with the summons being issued on 14 December , leaving little time for attendees to respond . He summoned not only the barons , senior churchmen and two knights from each county , but also two burgesses from each of the major towns such as York , Lincoln , Sandwich , and the Cinque Ports , the first time this had been done . Due to the lack of support for Montfort among the barons , only 23 of them were summoned to parliament , in comparison to the summons issued to 120 churchmen , who largely supported the new government ; it is unknown how many burgesses were called . The event was overseen by King Henry , and held in the Palace of Westminster , London , which was the largest city in England , and whose continuing loyalty was essential to Montfort 's cause .
Recording sessions for The Joshua Tree began in January 1986 in Danesmoate House in Dublin , Ireland , and continued throughout the year . U2 briefly interrupted these sessions in June to join Amnesty International 's A Conspiracy of Hope tour . Following the first concert in San Francisco , lead singer Bono met Ren Castro , a Chilean mural artist . Castro had been tortured and held in a concentration camp for two years by the dictatorial Chilean government because his artwork criticised the Pinochet - led regime that seized power in 1973 during a coup d ' tat . Castro showed Bono a wall painting in the Mission District that depicted the ongoing plight in Chile and Argentina . He also learned of the Madres de Plaza de Mayo , a group of women whose children were forcibly disappeared by the Argentine government . The Madres ' children were students who had opposed the government during the Dirty War , and the coup d ' tat that brought Jorge Rafael Videla into power . The Madres joined together to campaign for information regarding the locations of their children 's bodies and the circumstances of their deaths , believing them to have been kidnapped , tortured , and murdered .
Moultrie saw Sullivan 's Island , a sandy spit of land at the entrance to Charleston Harbor extending north about 4 miles 6 . 4 km long and a few hundred yards wide , as a place well suited to build a fort that could protect the entrance from intruding enemy warships . A large vessel sailing into Charleston first had to cross Charleston Bar , a series of submerged shoals lying about 8 miles 13 km southeast of the city , and then pass by the southern end of Sullivan 's Island as it entered the channel to the inner harbor . Later it would also have to pass the northern end of James Island , where Fort Johnson commanded the southeastern approach to the city . Moultrie and his 2nd South Carolina Regiment arrived on Sullivan 's Island in March 1776 , and began construction of a fortress to defend the island and the channel into Charleston Harbor . The construction moved slowly ; Captain Peter Horry of the Patriot naval detachment described the site as an immense pen 500 feet long , and 16 feet wide , filled with sand to stop the shot . The gun platforms were made of planks two inches thick and fastened with wooden spikes .
In modern Zimbabwe , it is not the Viscount shootdowns but rather the retributory Rhodesian strikes against nationalist guerrilla camps that endure predominantly in the cultural memory . State media in Zimbabwe , prominently the Herald newspaper , often claim that Rhodesian forces indiscriminately and deliberately slaughtered thousands of helpless refugees during such operations . ZIPRA 's downing of civilian planes is meanwhile portrayed as a legitimate act of war on the grounds that the guerrillas might have believed them to have military personnel or equipment on board . The massacre of surviving Flight 825 passengers at the crash site is often omitted or attributed to forces other than ZIPRA ; in his 1984 memoirs Nkomo repeated his claim that ZIPRA fighters had helped the survivors , and wrote simply that I truly have no idea how the ten died .

Highland Park houses a Jimmie Rodgers museum which displays the original guitar of The Singing Brakeman and other memorabilia of his life and career , as well as railroad equipment from the steam - engine era . In addition to the museum building itself , there are outside memorials , and a vintage steam locomotive on display . A Mississippi Blues Trail historic marker has been placed in Meridian to honor the city as the birthplace of Jimmie Rodgers and emphasizes his importance to the development of the blues style of music in Mississippi . The city was the first site to receive this designation outside the Mississippi Delta . Also , a Mississippi Country Music Trail marker was placed in Oak Grove Cemetery in honor of Rodgers on June 1 , 2010 . Each year since 1953 , the city has held a festival during May to honor the anniversary of his death .

In February 1942 , Casterman suggested to Herg that his books be published in a new format ; 62 - pages rather than the former 100 to 130 pages , and now in full colour rather than black - and - white . He agreed to this , and in 1943 The Crab with the Golden Claws was re - edited and coloured for publication as an album in 1944 . Due to the changes in how the adventure had been serialised at Le Soir , the album at this juncture was only 58 pages long , and thus Herg filled the missing pages with four full - page colour frames , thus bringing it up to the standard 62 - page format .

2nd Battalion , 9th Marines 2 9 was an infantry battalion of the United States Marine Corps . Formed during World War I , the unit played an instrumental role in the defeat of the Japanese forces in the Battles of Guam and Iwo Jima during the World War II . The battalion distinguished itself in the defense of Khe Sanh during the Vietnam War , and later participated in an ill fated invasion of Koh Tang Island in Southeast Asia , with the intention of rescuing the crew of the SS Mayaguez . During Operation Desert Storm , the battalion served as the lead battalion for the III Marine Expeditionary Force III MEF .
Lawton continued to train his heading skills intensely in the summer of 1936 , and also played cricket for Burnley Cricket Club as a batsman in the Lancashire League . He scored a six against both Learie Constantine and Amar Singh . He scored 369 runs in 15 completed innings for an average of 24 . 06 .

The release for the film was originally planned for 2007 , then 2008 and 2009 , before its 2010 release . Clips of the film were shown at Wikimania 2007 in Taipei prior to its completion . Editors in the audience had mixed views on the film . In 2008 , footage from the film was used in an official fundraising video by the Wikimedia Foundation . The film had its premiere at Wikimania 2010 in Gda sk in July 2010 , before an audience of approximately 300 people . A trailer for the movie was released in October 2010 .
Adam Gutschmidt , reviewing the event for Online Onslaught , gave a rating of one - quarter star for the Nightstick on a Pole match and one - half star each for the High Energy vs. The Headshrinkers match and the Yokozuna vs. Virgil match . He enjoyed the WWF Championship match , although he was disappointed by its lack of buildup prior to the event . He also felt that the Flair Ramon vs. Savage Perfect match was a good one until the ending got out of control . Pro Wrestling Torch columnist agreed , stating that the WWF Championship match was the best and that the Flair Ramon vs. Savage Perfect bout was also enjoyable , but he recommended fast - forwarding through the rest of the show .
Some special effects , like Motoko 's thermo - optical camouflage , were rendered through the use of TIMA software . The process uses a single illustration and manipulates the image as necessary to produce distortions for effect in combination with a background without altering the original illustration . The effect is re - added back into the shot to complete the scene . While the visual displays used in the film were technically simple to create , the appearance of the displays underwent numerous revisions by the production team to best represent visual displays of the future . Another aspect of the CG use was to create images and effects that looked as if they were perceived by the brain and were generated in video and added to the film in its final stages .
Markgraf was present for the uneventful advance in the direction of Sunderland on 18 20 October . Unit training with the III Squadron followed from 21 October to 2 November . Two days later , the ship formally rejoined III Squadron . On the 5th , a pair of U - boats grounded on the Danish coast . Light forces were sent to recover the vessels , and III Squadron , which was in the North Sea en route to Wilhelmshaven , was ordered to cover them . During the operation , the British submarine J1 torpedoed both Grosser Kurf rst and Kronprinz and caused moderate damage . For most of 1917 , Markgraf was occupied with guard duties in the North Sea , interrupted only by a refit period in January and periodic unit training in the Baltic .
In the early hours of 7 October the allied artillery and mortar bombardment began , targeting Chinese positions on the Hinge . Hassett moved the 3 RAR tactical headquarters on to Hill 317 just before the assaulting troops stepped off the line of departure , allowing him to direct the battle from a forward position and to co - ordinate fire support . Waiting for the fog to lift so that the artillery could fire until the last safe moment , the attack finally began at 08 : 00 . B Company moved off down the ridgeline , with two - up and one - in - depth , using the trees and long grass for concealment . Initially it seemed that the Chinese had withdrawn during the night , when suddenly the lead Australian platoons were engulfed by small arms fire from their rear . A series of intense fire - fights ensued as the Australians fought back and by 09 : 20 the Hinge finally fell , with the Australians losing two killed and 20 wounded .

Since the last quarter of the 20th century , with a re - emergence of wealth in Ireland , a New Irish Cuisine based on traditional ingredients incorporating international influences has emerged . This cuisine is based on fresh vegetables , fish especially salmon , trout , oysters , mussels and other shellfish , as well as traditional soda breads and the wide range of hand - made cheeses that are now being produced across the country . The potato remains however a fundamental feature of this cuisine and the Irish remain the highest per capita consumers of potatoes in Europe . An example of this new cuisine is Dublin Lawyer : lobster cooked in whiskey and cream . Traditional regional foods can be found throughout the country , for example coddle in Dublin or drisheen in Cork , both a type of sausage , or blaa , a doughy white bread particular to Waterford .
Few records of the church 's history exist , possibly because no single denomination or organization took ownership . Several Christian denominations held meetings at Old Pine Church , including the Schwarzenau Brethren or German Baptist Brethren , which began holding services at the church in the late 19th century . As many of the Mill Creek valley 's settlers were of German descent , the Old Pine Church structure may also have been built as a meeting place for Brethren adherents , known as Dunkers or Dunkards . It is believed that Old Pine Church was also used by German Methodists . The Brethren was a Christian denomination of Anabaptist origin that practiced baptism by triune immersion and exercised nonresistance . Triune immersion consists of dipping a new believer into water three times , once for each of the entities of the Holy Trinity . Brethren adherents believed only in the New Testament , and professed no other creeds . The interior of Old Pine Church , which consists of a single common space for all worshippers , also illustrates the building 's connection with the Brethren and the denomination 's beliefs regarding slavery . According to the minutes from the 1782 meeting of the Brethren in Franklin County , Virginia , It has been unanimously considered that it cannot be permitted in any way by the church that a member should purchase Negroes or keep them as Slaves . While many residents in Hampshire County prior to the American Civil War were slaveholders , it is thought that Brethren adherents in the county did not own slaves or depend upon slave labor .

Throughout the season , sea surface temperatures within the western equatorial Pacific were above normal , including those in the South China Sea . Areas of convection persisted year - round in the lower latitudes , particularly around the Philippines . Atmospheric divergence was also prevalent in the same regions , resulting in enhanced tropical cyclogenesis east of the Philippines in 2003 ; the mean region of development of tropical systems during the year was more southwest than the 1971 2000 30 - year average . In 2003 , the JMA monitored 21 tropical cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity ; of those , 14 reached typhoon intensity . Though the number of tropical storms was below average , the ratio between tropical storms and typhoons was 66 greater than normal . The Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration PAGASA monitored three additional cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity that were not monitored by the JMA .

The RAAF 's area command structure was revised in 1942 , following the outbreak of the Pacific War : Northern Area was split into North - Eastern Area and North - Western Area , and a new command covering New South Wales and southern Queensland , Eastern Area , was created , making a total of five commands . In October 1943 , the Air Board proposed carving a new Central Area Command out of Eastern Area , which by then was considered too large to be controlled by one headquarters and therefore ripe for subdivision . This Central Area Command would have been responsible for training and operational units in southern Queensland . The War Cabinet deferred its decision on the proposal . The concept was raised again in August 1944 , and this time the new Central Area Command was to control maintenance units , as well as training and operations , in southern Queensland . Once again , nothing came of the proposal .

In front of Marlborough the rest of the van had mixed success . HMS Bellerophon and HMS Leviathan were both still suffering the effects of their exertions earlier in the week and did not breach the enemy line . Instead they pulled along the near side of ole and America respectively and brought them to close gunnery duels . Rear - Admiral Thomas Pasley of Bellerophon was an early casualty , losing a leg in the opening exchanges . HMS Royal Sovereign , Graves 's flagship , was less successful due to a miscalculation of distance that resulted in her pulling up too far from the French line and coming under heavy fire from her opponent Terrible . In the time it took to engage Terrible more closely , Royal Sovereign suffered a severe pounding and Admiral Graves was badly wounded .
The snake 's cytotoxic venom itself is not considered particularly toxic based on tests conducted in mice . In mice , the LD50 is 0 . 8 5 . 0 mg kg IV , 2 . 0 mg kg IP and 5 . 0 6 . 0 mg kg SC . However , the venom glands are enormous and each bite produces the largest quantities of venom of any venomous snake ; this is partially due to the fact that , unlike many African vipers such as the Puff Adder , the Gaboon viper does not release after a bite , which enables it to inject larger amounts of venom . Yield is probably related to body weight , as opposed to milking interval . Brown 1973 gives a venom yield range of 200 1000 mg of dried venom , A range of 200 600 mg for specimens 125 155 cm in length has also been reported . Spawls and Branch 1995 state from 5 to 7 ml 450 600 mg of venom may be injected in a single bite .

The 2007 Formula One season was dominated by Ferrari 's accusations that the McLaren team had made illegal use of their intellectual property , leading to legal cases in the United Kingdom and Italy . Unlike previous cases , such as the Toyota team 's illegal use of Ferrari intellectual property in 2004 that had been handled by German police , the FIA investigated . They initially found McLaren innocent ; unable to find enough evidence to suggest that anyone other than designer Mike Coughlan had seen the information or that the team had used it . Ron Dennis , team principal of McLaren , was unaware at this point that Mosley had been sent personal e - mails from Fernando Alonso , stating that the data had been used and seen by others in the team . When Italian police uncovered a series of text messages between McLaren and their spy at Ferrari , the team was hauled in front of the World Motor Sports Council WMSC once more . This time they were found guilty and eventually fined a gross 100M and excluded from the 2007 constructors ' championship . Later in the year , the Renault team was found guilty by the FIA of possessing McLaren 's intellectual property , but was not punished , as the FIA 's WMSC decided there was not enough evidence to show the championship had been affected . In relation to McLaren , triple world champion Jackie Stewart criticised Mosley and stated that other teams did not back McLaren for fear of repercussions . TV commentator and newspaper columnist Martin Brundle , a former driver , was among those who criticised the FIA and Mosley for inconsistency and questioned the energetic manner in which he felt McLaren was being pursued , suggesting that there was a witch hunt against the team . Brundle and The Sunday Times subsequently received a writ for libel before the paper printed a correction . Mosley went on to defend himself of the charges made by Brundle , highlighting that the WMSC originally acquitted McLaren of any wrongdoing , stating : Concrete evidence of use by McLaren of the Ferrari information was simply not there . It was only later in the year when e - mails emerged which showed others inside McLaren were indeed aware of the Ferrari information , that the FIA found the team guilty .
The Beetons decided to revamp The Englishwoman 's Domestic Magazine , particularly the fashion column , which the historian Graham Nown describes as a rather drab piece . They travelled to Paris in March 1860 to meet Adolphe Goubaud , the publisher of the French magazine Le Moniteur de la Mode . The magazine carried a full - sized dress pattern outlined on a fold - out piece of paper for users to cut out and make their own dresses . The Beetons came to an agreement with Goubaud for the Frenchman to provide patterns and illustrations for their magazine . The first edition to carry the new feature appeared on 1 May , six weeks after the couple returned from Paris . For the redesigned magazine , Samuel was joined as editor by Isabella , who was described as Editress . As well as being co - editors , the couple were also equal partners . Isabella brought an efficiency and strong business acumen to Samuel 's normally disorganised and financially wasteful approach . She joined her husband at work , travelling daily by train to the office , where her presence caused a stir among commuters , most of whom were male . In June 1860 Isabella and Samuel travelled to Killarney , Ireland , for a fortnight 's holiday , leaving their son at home with his nurse . The Beetons enjoyed the sightseeing , although on the days it rained , they stayed inside their hotel and worked on the next edition of The Englishwoman 's Domestic Magazine . Isabella was impressed with the food they were served , and wrote in her diary that the dinners were conducted in quite the French style .
Meanwhile , the AFC had undergone remarkable development , and its independence as a separate national force was unique among the Dominions .

The book reviews in Super Science Stories were of a higher standard than elsewhere in the field , and historian Paul Carter regards Astonishing and Super Science Stories as the place where book reviewing for the first time began to merit the term ' literary criticism ' , adding that it was in those magazines that the custom began of paying attention to science fiction on the stage and screen also . The artwork was initially amateurish , and although it improved over the years , even the better artists such as Virgil Finlay and Lawrence Stevens continued to produce cliched depictions of half - dressed women threatened by robots or aliens . H. R. van Dongen , later a prolific cover artist for Astounding , made his first science fiction art sale to Super Science Stories for the cover of the September 1950 issue .
Folk lyricist Vangapandu Prasada Rao alleged that his 40 - year - old folk song Em Pillado Eldamostavaa , which was featured in T. Krishna 's Ardharathri Swatanthram 1986 , was used by film director Rajamouli and Allu Aravind in the Magadheera song Jorsey without Rao 's consent . Activists of PDSU , POW and PYL staged a protest demonstration in front of the Ashok 70 MM theatre in Nizamabad , where the film was screened , to demand the removal of the song . The protesters said that the song was written by Rao during the famous Srikakulam armed struggle four decades prior and had been misused to portray an obscene duet in the film .

They demanded a public apology by the makers to Rao . A few reports stated that Rao demanded Aravind pay him compensation of 5 million .

Pre - industrialisation , the family worked together as a unit and was self - sufficient . Beginning with the Industrial Revolution , large - scale production replaced home manufacturing ; this shift , coupled with prevailing norms governing sex or gender roles , dictated that the father become the breadwinner and the mother the caregiver . When affection - based marriages emerged in the 1830s , parents began devoting more attention to children and family relationships became more open . Beginning during World War II , many women entered the workforce out of necessity ; women resumed the caregiver position after the war , but their new - found sense of independence changed the traditional family structure together with cultural shifts leading to the feminist movement and advances in birth control . Some women opted to return to the care giver role . Others chose to pursue careers . When women chose to work outside of the home , alternative childcare became a necessity . If childcare options were too costly , unavailable , or undesirable , the stay - at - home dad became a viable option .

The invisible rail is superficially similar to the purple swamphen , Porphyrio porphyrio , which has recently been found in Halmahera , but that species is larger , with a short , thick red bill and a red forehead shield ; it also has purple underparts and a white undertail . The invisible rail is different from the Calayan rail , Gallirallus calayanensis , in that it is larger and lacks the barred plumage of that species ; there is no overlap between the ranges of the two species .
Although Gore was well received by the British establishment , the work suffered from what Gore called a tediousness of process , and he considered requesting a transfer in 1798 . In 1800 it ground to a halt because another board established by the treaty to resolve outstanding Revolutionary War claims against the United States had not yet met , and the British stopped the claims processing until resolution of the other issues got underway . Gore used this break to briefly return to America and assess the condition of his Waltham estate , where the house had been largely destroyed by fire in 1799 . After his return to London , with the commission work still stopped , he and Rebecca embarked on a tour of Europe . They visited Holland , Belgium , and Switzerland , and spent six months in Paris . During this trip , and later ones in England and Scotland , they took note of the architecture of country estates , and began planning a new house for their Waltham property .
A pamphlet detailing the burning in April 1652 of Joan Peterson , the so - called Witch of Wapping , also describes the execution of Prudence Lee , found guilty of mariticide . Lee was apparently brought on foot , between two sheriff 's officers and dressed in a red waistcoat , to the place of execution in Smithfield . There she confessed to having been a very lewd liver , and much given to cursing and swearing , for which the Lord being offended with her , had suffered her to be brought to that untimely end . She admitted to being jealous of and arguing with her husband , and stabbing him with a knife . The executioner put her in a pitch barrel , tied her to the stake , placed the fuel and faggots around her and set them alight . Lee was reported to have desired all that were present to pray for her and , feeling the flames , shrike d out terribly some five or six several times . Burning alive for murder was abolished in 1656 , although burning for adultery remained . Thereafter , out of mercy , the condemned were often strangled before the flames took hold . Notable exceptions to this practice were the burnings in 1685 and 1726 of Elizabeth Gaunt , found guilty of high treason for her part in the Rye House Plot , and Catherine Hayes , for petty treason . Hayes apparently rent the air with her cries and lamentations when the fire was lit too early , preventing the executioner from strangling her in time . She became the last woman in England to be burned alive .
As the sun rose on 14 September , pockets of Japanese soldiers remained scattered along both sides of the ridge . But with Tamura 's battalion shattered after losing of its officers and men , and with heavy casualties to his other attacking units as well , Kawaguchi 's assault on the ridge had effectively ended . About 100 Japanese soldiers still remained in the open on the south slope of Hill 80 , perhaps preparing for one more charge on Hill 123 . At first light , three U.S. Army aircraft from the 67th Fighter Squadron at Henderson Field , acting on a request personally delivered by Bailey , strafed the Japanese near Hill 80 and killed most of them , with the few survivors retreating back into the jungle .
Direct treatment of the thing , whether subjective or objective .
Thomas argues that the world of Thunderbirds is similar to the 1960s to the extent that contemporary capitalism and class structures appear to have survived mostly intact . He also observes , however , that wealth and high social status are often depicted as character flaws rather than strengths . According to Thomas , a contributing factor to the series ' lasting popularity is the realism of IR 's machines . Newman , for his part , suggests that the point isn 't realism . The 21st century of Thunderbirds is detailed ... but also de - populated , a high - tech toyland . He is more negative in his comparisons of contemporary and future values , noting the square , almost 50s attitudes to race , gender and class . With regard to stereotyping , Hood comments that he would be happier if villains didn 't seem to be recognisable by their pigmentation . Cull , by contrast , considers the series largely progressive on the subject of race , arguing that it rejects negative stereotyping through the use of positive non - white characters such as Kyrano and Tin - Tin . However , he deems many of the one - off villains derivative , commenting that these characters are typically presented as corrupt businessmen , spivs and gangsters familiar from crime films .
During the late 1950s , Braathens SAFE started looking for a replacement for the aging DC - 3s and Herons . An order was placed with Fokker for the delivery of their new Fokker F - 27 Friendship , a two - engine turboprop with cabin pressurization . Braathens SAFE was the second airline to receive the plane , after Aer Lingus . The first craft , LN - SUN , was delivered in December 1958 , with the second , LN - SUO , delivered the following year . They were put into service on the main routes : once daily Oslo Trondheim , once daily Oslo lesund , twice daily Oslo Stavanger , including one stopping at Kristiansand , and one trip daily Bergen lesund Trondheim . The delivery of the Friendships made the Herons unnecessary , and these were sold . The two DC - 3s were kept as a reserve , and were used for the first part of the summer schedules because of late delivery of LN - SUO . They were also used for charter . The airports at Hamar , Farsund and T nsberg had too short runways for the Friendship , and these destinations were terminated .
Wales faced England at Twickenham for Gatland 's inaugural match as coach and their first match of the 2008 Six Nations . They had not defeated England there since 1988 , and went on to win 26 19 . They eventually won all their Championship matches , conceding only two tries in the process , to claim another Grand Slam . Later that year Wales defeated Australia 21 18 in Cardiff , but then started a six - year , twenty - three - game win - less streak against the southern hemisphere nations of Australia , New Zealand and South Africa .
Low - level operations continued , however , with a small Australian force of 80 soldiers remaining in Iraq to protect the Australian Embassy in Baghdad as part of SECDET under Operation Kruger . SECDET was finally withdrawn in August 2011 , and was replaced by a private military company which took over responsibility for providing security for Australia 's diplomatic presence in Iraq . Although more than 17 , 000 personnel served during operations in Iraq , Australian casualties were relatively light , with two soldiers accidentally killed , while a third Australian died serving with the British Royal Air Force . A further 27 personnel were wounded . Two officers remained in Iraq attached to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq as part of Operation Riverbank . This operation concluded in November 2013 .
Operation Tonga was the last that Tetrarchs saw of active combat . During the first week of October 1944 , the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment underwent an extensive reorganization , in which it was completely restructured , and all the remaining Tetrarchs were retired . They were replaced with the M22 Locust , a purpose - built airborne light tank of American design ; eight Locusts were used by the regiment in March 1945 during Operation Varsity , the airborne operation to cross the river Rhine . A report issued by the Director Air of the War Office in January 1946 confirmed that the Tetrarch design was considered obsolete , and any light tanks used in post - war airborne formations would be entirely new in design . A small number of Tetrarchs remained in service with the 3rd Hussars until 1949 ; a Hamilcar glider flight was stationed at RAF Fairford , and a troop of Tetrarchs was kept by the regiment for training exercises with the gliders . However , glider training by the regiment was stopped in 1950 and the Tetrarchs withdrawn from service .
Ceratopsia was coined by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1890 to include dinosaurs possessing certain characteristic features , including horns , a rostral bone , teeth with two roots , fused neck vertebrae , and a forward - oriented pubis . Marsh considered the group distinct enough to warrant its own suborder within Ornithischia . The name is derived from the Greek keras meaning ' horn ' and opsis meaning ' face ' . As early as the 1960s , it was noted that the name Ceratopsia is actually incorrect linguistically and that it should be Ceratopia . However , this spelling , while technically correct , has been used only rarely in the scientific literature , and the vast majority of paleontologists continue to use Ceratopsia . As the ICZN does not govern taxa above the level of superfamily , this is unlikely to change .
He took part in a fourth round League Cup hammering of Stoke City , scoring a hat - trick in an 8 0 victory , which was second only to the club 's biggest ever win in 1986 a 10 0 defeat of Fulham . In the League Cup final against Birmingham City , the club 's first cup final since 1996 , he captained the side and scored in the 30th minute . Liverpool went on to win the trophy on penalties , with Fowler scoring Liverpool 's fifth in the shootout . Fowler picked up the Alan Hardaker Man of the Match award and lifted the trophy .

Determined to promote the work of the Imagists , and particularly of Aldington and H.D. , Pound decided to publish an anthology under the title Des Imagistes . It was first published in Alfred Kreymborg 's little magazine The Glebe and was later published in 1914 by Alfred and Charles Boni in New York and by Harold Monro at the Poetry Bookshop in London . It became one of the most important and influential English - language collections of modernist verse . Included in the thirty - seven poems were ten poems by Aldington , seven by H.D. , and six by Pound . The book also included work by F.S. Flint , Skipwith Cannell , Amy Lowell , William Carlos Williams , James Joyce , Ford Madox Ford , Allen Upward and John Cournos.Max Michelson was also another included in the important 1963 anthology by William Pratt The Imagist Poem Modern Poetry in miniature .

The majority of Australian units in the Mediterranean returned to Australia in early 1942 , after the outbreak of the Pacific War . The 9th Division was the largest unit to remain in the Middle East , and played a key role in the First Battle of El Alamein during June and the Second Battle of El Alamein in October . The division returned to Australia in early 1943 , but several RAAF squadrons and RAN warships took part in the subsequent Tunisia Campaign and the Italian Campaign from 1943 until the end of the war .

On 13 October , the majority of the fleet conducted a sweep into the North Sea , returning to port on 15 October . During 2 5 November , Marlborough participated in a fleet training operation west of the Orkneys . Another such cruise took place during 1 4 December . The typical routine of gunnery drills and squadron exercises occurred in January 1916 . The fleet departed for a cruise in the North Sea on 26 February ; Jellicoe had intended to use the Harwich Force to sweep the Heligoland Bight , but bad weather prevented operations in the southern North Sea . As a result , the operation was confined to the northern end of the sea . On the night of 25 March , Iron Duke and the rest of the fleet sailed from Scapa Flow , to support the Battlecruiser Fleet and other light forces that raided the German zeppelin base at Tondern .
The degree to which Tennyson identifies with Ulysses has provided one of the great debates among scholars of the poem . Critics who find that Tennyson identifies with the speaker read Ulysses ' speech affirmatively , or without irony . Many other interpretations of the poem have developed from the argument that Tennyson does not identify with Ulysses , and further criticism has suggested that the purported inconsistencies in Ulysses ' character are the fault of the poet himself .
In August , Paramount , with the help of other stockholders , seized full control of DuMont Laboratories . The last non - sports program on DuMont , the game show What 's the Story , aired on September 23 , 1955 . After that , DuMont 's network feed was used only for occasional sporting events . DuMont 's last broadcast , a boxing match , aired on August 6 , 1956 . The date has also been reported as April 1950 , September 1955 , or August 4 , 1958 . According to one source , the final program aired on only five stations nationwide . It appears that the boxing show was syndicated to a few other east coast stations until 1958 , but likely not as a production of DuMont or its successor company .
Writing Kannada literature in native metres was first popularised by the court poets . These metres were the sangatya , compositions sung to the accompaniment of a musical instrument ; shatpadi , six - line verses ; ragale , lyrical compositions in blank verse ; and tripadi , three - line verses . However , Jain writers continued to use the traditional champu , composed of prose and verse . Important literary contributions in Kannada were made not only by court poets but also by noblemen , commanders , ministers , ascetics and saints associated with monasteries .
Due to their great distance from the Earth , all stars except the Sun appear to the unaided eye as shining points in the night sky that twinkle because of the effect of the Earth 's atmosphere . The Sun is also a star , but it is close enough to the Earth to appear as a disk instead , and to provide daylight . Other than the Sun , the star with the largest apparent size is R Doradus , with an angular diameter of only 0 . 057 arcseconds .
Communications scholar Arthur Kroker argues that Innis 's study of the Canadian Pacific Railway was only the first in which he attempted to demonstrate that technology is not something external to Canadian being ; but on the contrary , is the necessary condition and lasting consequence of Canadian existence . It also reflected Innis 's lifelong interest in the exercise of economic and political power . His CPR history ends , for example , with a recounting of Western grievances against economic policies , such as high freight rates and the steep import tariffs designed to protect fledgling Canadian manufacturers . Westerners complained that this National Policy funnelled money from Prairie farmers into the pockets of the Eastern business establishment . Western Canada , Innis wrote , has paid for the development of Canadian nationality , and it would appear that it must continue to pay . The acquisitiveness of Eastern Canada shows little sign of abatement . 
Die Another Day was written into a novel by the then - current official James Bond writer , Raymond Benson , based on the screenplay by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade . Fan reaction to it was above average . After its publication Benson retired as the official James Bond novelist and a new series featuring the secret agent 's adventures as a teenager , by Charlie Higson , was launched in 2005 . As the novelisation was published after Benson 's final original 007 novel , The Man with the Red Tattoo , it was the final literary work featuring Bond as originally conceived by Ian Fleming until the publication of Devil May Care by Sebastian Faulks in 2008 to mark the 100th anniversary of Fleming 's birth .

In French cooking , plums are an ingredients in a significant tradition of cake making : ... throughout the districts of the Loire , the Dordogne , the Lot and the P rigord , there was hardly a celebration , a wedding feast or celebration at which the dessert did not include some sort of plum or mirabelle tart , made with fresh or dried plums or jam according to the season . The Mirabelle plum is a specific cultivar used to make Tarte aux mirabelles plum tart . A Galette aux fruits is a type of galette made with yeast dough and covered with previously cooked fruit in season , such as plums or quinces , apples , apricots . The fruit in these open tarts or flans is cut into suitably sized pieces and the cake is glazed : red glaze is recommended for red plum and rhubarb flans , whereas apricot glaze is recommended in yellow plum and apricot flans .
Political conflicts in Vienna delayed Austria 's entry into the Third Coalition until 1805 . After hostilities of the War of the Second Coalition ended in 1801 , Archduke Charles--the emperor 's brother--took advantage of the subsequent years of peace to develop a military restructuring plan . He carefully put this plan into effect beginning in 1803 04 , but implementation was incomplete in 1805 when Karl Mack , Lieutenant Field Marshal and Quartermaster - General of the Army , implemented his own restructuring . Mack bypassed Charles ' methodical approach . Occurring in the field , Mack 's plan also undermined the overall command and organizational structure . Regardless , Mack sent an enthusiastic report to Vienna on the military 's readiness . Furthermore , after misreading Napoleon 's maneuvers in W rttemberg , Mack also reported to Vienna on the weakness of French dispositions . His reports convinced the war party advising the emperor , Francis II , to enter the conflict against France , despite Charles ' own advice to the contrary . Responding to the report and rampant anti - French fever in Vienna , Francis dismissed Charles from his post as generalissimo and appointed his Francophobic brother - in - law , Archduke Ferdinand , as commander .
 You 're Gonna Love Tomorrow 
Baltimore spent the last two years of his life constantly lobbying for his new charter , though the obstacles proved difficult . The Virginians , led by William Claiborne , who sailed to England to make the case , campaigned aggressively against separate colonising of the Chesapeake , claiming they possessed the rights to that area . Baltimore was short of capital , having exhausted his fortune , and was sometimes forced to depend on the assistance of his friends . To make matters worse , in the summer of 1630 , his household was infected by the plague , which he survived . He wrote to Wentworth : Blessed be God for it who hath preserved me now from shipwreck , hunger , scurvy and pestilence ... 
The term Wicca was employed in an increasingly eclectic manner by authors like RavenWolf , who considered it to be a synonym for witchcraft . In turn it began to be adopted on a wider scale , being popularised in India by Ipsita Roy Chakraverti and being adopted by a French Luciferian group , Le Wicca Fran aise . Becoming widely known in western popular culture , it was utilised by the script writers of two popular American television shows , Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Charmed ; the first episode of the latter was titled Something Wicca This Way Comes while the tenth was titled Wicca Envy .
Antimony III sulfide , Sb2S3 , was recognized in predynastic Egypt as an eye cosmetic kohl as early as about 3100 BC , when the cosmetic palette was invented .

Another possible reference to the church may be in a marginal note from 1358 to a copy of the Acts of the Apostles . In the note , the copyist , one Laloe , thanks God and the Holy and Most Glorious Ascension for having finished his work on the book . Scholar Bistra Nikolova believes this to be an allusion to the Patriarchal Cathedral , which may have patronised the project . Alternatively , the copy could have been made at the cathedral 's scriptorium , where Laloe may have worked .
He also accused Thaksin of spying on the military while he was Prime Minister .

At least one fatality off southern California has resulted from the long , venomous tail spine of the diamond stingray . However , it is not aggressive and will usually flee given the opportunity . This ray is not found off the United States in sufficient numbers to be economically important . Elsewhere in its range , it is caught in substantial numbers for human consumption , both intentionally and as bycatch ; the pectoral fins or wings are sold fresh or filleted and salted . The International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN notes that the diamond stingray 's low reproductive productivity renders it susceptible to population depletion , but currently lacks enough biological and fishery data to assess it beyond Data Deficient overall , or in the U.S. , Central , and South American parts of its range .

From the beginning of the First Civil War , the Long Parliament recognized that they would need assistance from the Scots . In return for a military alliance , the Scottish Parliament required the English to sign the Solemn League and Covenant in 1643 , which stipulated that the English would bring their church into greater conformity with the Church of Scotland . The Scottish Parliament sent commissioners to London to represent Scotland 's interests to the English Parliament . Eleven of these , four theologians and seven members of Parliament , were also invited to the Assembly . The commissioners were given the opportunity to become full voting members of the Assembly but declined , preferring to maintain their independence as commissioners of their own nation and church . Samuel Rutherford , George Gillespie , and Alexander Henderson were the most outspoken of the commissioners .

Languedoc - Roussillon wine , including the vin de pays labeled Vin de Pays d 'Oc , is produced in southern France . While Languedoc can refer to a specific historic region of France and Northern Catalonia , usage since the 20th century especially in the context of wine has primarily referred to the northern part of the Languedoc - Roussillon r gion of France , an area which spans the Mediterranean coastline from the French border with Spain to the region of Provence . The area has around 700 , 000 acres 2 , 800 km2 under vines and is the single biggest wine - producing region in the world , being responsible for more than a third of France 's total wine production . In 2001 , the region produced more wine than the United States .

Coleman received 25 , 000 for the publishing rights to Of Human Feelings but said his managers sold it for less than the recording costs and that he did not receive any of its royalties . According to Stan Bernstein , Coleman had financial expectations that were unrealistic in this business unless you 're Michael Jackson . Antilles label executive Ron Goldstein felt the 25 , 000 Coleman received was neither a great nor a fair amount for someone in jazz . After he had gone over budget to record a follow - up album , Island did not release it nor pick up their option on him , and in 1983 , he left the Bernstein Agency . He chose Denardo Coleman to manage his career while overcoming his reticence of public performance , which had been rooted in his distrust of doing business with a predominantly White music industry . According to Nicholson , the man once accused of standing on the throat of jazz was welcomed back to the touring circuits with both curiosity and affection during the 1980s . Coleman did not record another album for six years and instead performed internationally with Prime Time .
The F - 28s had the largest regularity problems , mostly due to the number of landings , which could count up to 16 per day . For instance , LN - SUO flew 36 , 000 hours with 76 , 000 landings . The last flight was made on 16 December 1986 , and the aircraft sold for NOK 45 million each . Although the F - 28 was taken out of service , some of the routes on the West Coast needed to be operated with smaller aircraft than the 737 . The company made an agreement to wet lease Busy Bee F - 27s one some of the routes , while the most trafficked ones would be taken over by 737s .

Parry 1975 described how this species has a wider range of eye movement than other snakes . Along a horizontal plane , eye movement can be maintained even if the head is rotated up or down to an angle of up to 45 . If the head is rotated 360 , one eye will tilt up and the other down , depending on the direction of rotation . Also , if one eye looks forward , the other looks back , as if both are connected to a fixed position on an axis between them . In general , the eyes often flick back and forth in a rapid and jerky manner . When asleep , there is no eye movement and the pupils are strongly contracted . The pupils dilate suddenly and eye movement resumes when the animal wakes up .

Delaware changed hands between the Dutch and Swedes between 1631 and 1655 . The Dutch maintained control of Delaware until 1664 , when Sir Robert Carr took New Amstel for the Duke of York , renaming it New Castle . A Deputy of the Duke governed Delaware from 1664 to 1682 . When William Penn received his land grant of Pennsylvania in 1681 , he received the Delaware area from the Duke of York , and dubbed them The Three Lower Counties on the Delaware River . In 1701 , after he had troubles governing the ethnically diverse Delaware territory , Penn agreed to allow them a separate colonial assembly .

Beckham was expected to be the Democrats ' nominee for governor in 1935 , but the death of his son in late 1934 left him distraught and his wife opposed to another campaign . The Democrats turned to A. B. Happy Chandler of Henderson , who won the election . Beckham supported Chandler 's bid , and in return Chandler appointed him to the Kentucky Public Service Commission in 1936 . Beckham also served on the Department of Business Regulations Commission and chaired the State Government Reorganization Commission .
The relationship between war and Australian society has been shaped by two of the more enduring themes of Australian strategic culture : bandwagoning with a powerful ally and expeditionary warfare . Indeed , Australian defence policy was closely linked to Britain until the Japanese crisis of 1942 , while since then an alliance with the United States has underwritten its security . Arguably , this pattern of bandwagoning both for cultural reasons such as shared values and beliefs , as well as for more pragmatic security concerns has ensured that Australian strategic policy has often been defined by relations with its allies . Regardless , a tendency towards strategic complacency has also been evident , with Australians often reluctant to think about defence issues or to allocate resources until a crisis arises ; a trait which has historically resulted in unpreparedness for major military challenges .

Important polynomial time computational problems on DAGs include topological sorting finding a topological ordering , construction of the transitive closure and transitive reduction the largest and smallest DAGs with the same reachability relation , respectively , and the closure problem , in which the goal is to find a minimum - weight subset of vertices with no edges connecting them to the rest of the graph . Transforming a directed graph with cycles into a DAG by deleting as few vertices or edges as possible the feedback vertex set and feedback edge set problem , respectively is NP - hard , but any directed graph can be made into a DAG its condensation by contracting each strongly connected component into a single supervertex . The problems of finding shortest paths and longest paths can be solved on DAGs in linear time , in contrast to arbitrary graphs for which shortest path algorithms are slower and longest path problems are NP - hard .

The combined impacts of hurricanes Ingrid and Manuel affected two - thirds of Mexico , killing 192 people and causing 75 billion pesos MXN , 5 . 7 billion USD in damage . Most of the effects were due to Manuel , though Ingrid was directly responsible for at least 32 deaths and 20 billion pesos MXN , 1 . 5 billion USD in damage . The two storms produced 162 billion m3 5 . 7 trillion cu ft of water , the equivalent of filling every dam in Mexico . Rainfall from the storm peaked at 511 mm 20 . 1 in in Tuxpan , Veracruz . The rains caused widespread flooding , damaging at least 14 , 000 houses and hundreds of roads and bridges . In Tamaulipas , where the storm made landfall , the rainfall damaged crops and flooded rivers . The effects of the storm spread into southern Texas , causing high tides and some flooding . After the storm , the Mexican government declared several municipalities as states of emergency . Relief agencies distributed food and aid to the hardest hit areas , although in Tamaulipas , residents had to rely on assistance from the local Gulf Cartel . The names Ingrid and Manuel were both later retired due to their impacts .

Papa Stour 's most recent shipwreck occurred on 9 December 1977 when the Aberdeen trawler Elinor Viking A278 , skipper Alec Flett , foundered on the Ve Skerries . The Aith Lifeboat came to the scene but was unable to get near enough to rescue the crew because of the sea conditions . At the request of Alec Webster , Coastguard Station Officer , Lerwick , a volunteer crew in a British Airways Sikorsky S61N helicopter from Sumburgh Airport was scrambled . They managed to winch all the boat 's crew to safety within hours of the grounding , despite the storm force winds . The helicopter crew later received a number of awards for bravery . There was no loss of life , but this incident prompted the building of a lighthouse on the skerries in 1979 , and may also have been the example required for the formation of the present Search and Rescue helicopter unit , based at Sumburgh Airport .

In response , the Soviet Union sent a submarine armed with nuclear missiles from Vladivostok to trail the US task force . The event demonstrated the significance of nuclear weapons and ballistic missile submarines to then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi . Following the 1974 Smiling Buddha nuclear test , the Director of Marine Engineering DME at Naval Headquarters initiated a technical feasibility study for an indigenous nuclear propulsion system Project 932 .
As part of its maintenance duties , the Michigan Department of Transportation MDOT tracks the volume of traffic on the highways it maintains . This number is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic AADT , a calculation of the average traffic for a segment of roadway on any average day of the year . In 2009 , the department measured a peak of 19 , 719 vehicles daily on the stretch north of Tittabawasee Road . The section south of the US 10 interchange had the lowest traffic level at 9 , 315 vehicles AADT . Additionally , entire route of M - 47 has been listed on the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility .

Section 8 defined the short title as the Parliament Act 1911 .
A constitutional convention was assembled in the territory in July 1857 . Divisions between Republicans and Democrats led to the drafting of two separate constitutions . The larger cities of Saint Paul , Saint Anthony , and Stillwater were the domain of the Democrats whereas agrarian southern Minnesota was the domain of the Republicans . A single constitution was finally worked out between the two factions though the more powerful Democrats ultimately prevailed on most issues . The resentment between the two parties remained so acrimonious that two separate copies of the constitution had to be used so that members of each party did not have to sign a copy signed by members of the other party . The copies were signed on August 29 , 1857 and an election was called on October 13 , 1857 to approve the document . 30 , 055 voters approved the constitution , while 571 rejected it .
The broad McDermitt Caldera is a prominent geologic feature in the Trout Creek Mountains . The oval - shaped caldera is a collapsed lava dome that straddles the Oregon Nevada border on the eastern side of the range and south of the Oregon Canyon Mountains . It is about 28 miles 45 km long and 22 miles 35 km wide . The lava dome was created by volcanic eruptions in the early Miocene . A total of five large ash flows were produced along with a large rhyolite dome structure . The caldera formed when the dome collapsed about 16 million years ago . The caldera contains significant ore deposits , and mercury and uranium have been mined at eight or more sites in and around the caldera . Other areas in the caldera were mined for ores of antimony , cesium , and lithium .

Taylor argues that the fourth factor in Evita 's continued importance in Argentina relates to her status as a dead woman and the power that death holds over the public imagination . Taylor suggests that Evita 's embalmed corpse is analogous to the incorruptibility of various Catholic saints , such as Bernadette Soubirous , and has powerful symbolism within the largely Catholic cultures of Latin America :
The themes of the lyrics include contrast , contradictions and urgency . According to Jon Wiederhon of MTV News , Martin seems to address the helplessness of being in a dysfunctional relationship he doesn 't necessarily want to escape . The lyrics are cryptic ; the ending lines of the second verse emphasize contradicting emotion : Come out upon my seas Cursed missed opportunities Am I a part of the cure Or am I part of the disease ? The song 's title also metaphorically alludes to its lyrics , pushing one to wonder about the world 's obsession with time while connecting it to the theory : make the best of it when we re here , present and alive .

The disks of most stars are much too small in angular size to be observed with current ground - based optical telescopes , and so interferometer telescopes are required to produce images of these objects . Another technique for measuring the angular size of stars is through occultation . By precisely measuring the drop in brightness of a star as it is occulted by the Moon or the rise in brightness when it reappears , the star 's angular diameter can be computed .

After considering several actresses including Tamannaah for the princess role , Kajal Aggarwal was selected by Rajamouli as the female lead opposite Ram Charan after conducting a photoshoot in his office . Rajamouli said that he wanted to cast her as the female lead in Yamadonga 2007 after her Telugu debut Lakshmi Kalyanam 2007 , but she was unavailable . He added that he wanted somebody good looking , who would look like a princess and who had dates available and finalised her because she met all of these prerequisites . After conducting her photoshoot , Rajamouli explained the story and Mithra 's characterisation to her in 45 minutes . He said she needed to treat the hero arrogantly , but do so out of love for the hero . Kajal kept this in mind and acted accordingly while playing the dual roles of a princess from 400 years ago and a modern - day college student . Kajal called both her roles unique and challenging .
As well as addition , subtraction , multiplication and division , it had reciprocal and square - root functions , and the ability to multiply by a fixed constant . With an eight - digit display , the calculator could display positive numbers between 0 . 0000001 and 99 , 999 , 999 , and negative numbers between -0.000001 and -9,999,999 . Calculators of the time tended to have displays of between 3 and 12 digits , as reducing the number of digits was an effective way of reducing the cost of the calculator . A number outside that range leads to an overflow , and the screen flashes and all keys except the clear key are rendered inoperable to inform the user of the error . A independent memory register could read information from the screen , and information could only be taken from the memory onto the screen . Five keys were used for memory operations .
Following a change in management , Coleman signed with Island Records , and Of Human Feelings was released in 1982 by its subsidiary label Antilles Records . Critics generally praised Coleman 's expressive music and harmolodic approach , but the album made little commercial impact and went out of print .

At 17 : 20 McCay signalled Bridges that large numbers of unwounded men were leaving the battlefield and heading for the beaches . This was followed by Maclagan asking for urgent artillery fire support , onto Gun Ridge , as his left was under a heavy attack and at 18 : 16 Owen reported the left flank was rapidly being forced to retire . At dusk Maclagan made his way to Bridges headquarters and when asked for his opinion replied It 's touch and go . If the Turks come on in mass formation ... I don 't think anything can stop them . As it got dark the Turkish artillery ceased firing , and although small arms fire continued on both sides , the effects were limited when firing blind . Darkness also provided the opportunity to start digging more substantial trenches and to resupply the troops with water and ammunition .

The bell towers are the work of Xalapan artist Jos Dami n Ortiz de Castro . They are capped with bell - shaped roofs made of tezontle covered in chiluca , a white stone . Ortiz de Castro was in charge of the cathedral 's construction in the latter half of the 18th century until he died , unexpectedly . Manuel Tols of Valencia , who had built other notable buildings in Mexico City , was hired to finish the cathedral . At this point , the cathedral had already been 240 years in the making . He added the neo - Classic structure housing the clock , the statues of the three theological virtues Faith , Hope , and Charity , the high balustrade surrounding the building , and the dome that rises over the transept .
In Menominee County , the environment takes on a more agricultural character along US 2 . The highway passes through the edge of the community of Hermansville before entering Powers . US 2 comes to a three - way intersection and turns northeast merging onto US 41 . The concurrent highway runs from Powers through the communities of Wilson and Spaulding on the south side of the CN Railway . At Harris , the trunkline enters the Hannahville Indian Community . Harris is on the Menominee County side of the reservation , but as the highway continues east , it crosses over to Bark River on the Delta County side . The county line in between not only separates the two communities , but also serves as the boundary between the Central and Eastern time zones . East of Bark River , the highway crosses the community 's namesake waterway before intersecting the eastern terminus of M 69 . The roadway crosses the Ford River prior to turning due east into the outskirts of Escanaba .
There is a mixture of high - density urban areas , suburbs , semi - rural and rural locations in Oldham . There is some permanent grassland but overwhelmingly the land use in the town is urban . The territory of Oldham is contiguous with other towns on all sides except for a small section along its eastern and southern boundaries , and for purposes of the Office for National Statistics , forms the fourth largest settlement of the Greater Manchester Urban Area , the United Kingdom 's third largest conurbation . The M60 motorway passes through the southwest of Oldham , through Hollinwood , and a heavy rail line enters Oldham from the same direction , travelling northeast to the town centre before heading northwards through Derker towards Shaw and Crompton .
According to Suetonius ; Nero became Emperor at the age of 17 when the news of Claudius ' death was made known , making him the youngest emperor at that time Although , what Suetonius may have meant is that he was in his seventeenth year as his date of birth , also listed by Suetonius , would have made him 16 at the time of Claudius ' death . Tacitus , in book XIII of his Annals , describes Nero as being ' scarcely out of his boyhood ' at the time he became emperor . Ancient historians describe Nero 's early reign as being strongly influenced by his mother , Agrippina , his tutor Lucius Annaeus Seneca , and the Praetorian Prefect Sextus Afranius Burrus , especially in the first year . Other tutors were less often mentioned , such as Alexander of Aegae .

Selected special segments of the song will have glowing notes outlined by stars : successfully hitting all notes in this series will fill the Star Power Meter . The Star Power Meter can also be filled by using the whammy bar during sustained notes within these segments . Once the Star Power Meter is at least half full , the player can activate Star Power by pressing the select button or momentarily lifting the guitar into a vertical position . When Star Power is activated , the scoring multiplier is doubled until Star Power is depleted . The Rock Meter also increases more dramatically when Star Power is activated , making it easier for the player to make the Rock Meter stay at a high level . Thus , Star Power can be used strategically to play difficult sections of a song that otherwise might cause the player to fail . In the earlier entries of the series up until Guitar Hero : Aerosmith , activating Star Power meant that players could not accrue more Star Power until the Star Power meter was fully drained and the effect ended . Starting with Guitar Hero : World Tour , more Star Power can be collected even if the effect is active by completing more Star Power phrases , extending the Star Power 's duration by doing so . When playing in cooperative play with a bassist rhythm guitarist in Guitar Hero II through Guitar Hero : Aerosmith or as a band in Guitar Hero : World Tour , Star Power is shared between all the players and activation of Star Power is dependent on all players simultaneously activating it .
More generally , some scientific researchers have expressed objective concern over certain ingredients sometimes added to condoms , notably talc and nitrosamines . Dry dusting powders are applied to latex condoms before packaging to prevent the condom from sticking to itself when rolled up . Previously , talc was used by most manufacturers , but cornstarch is currently the most popular dusting powder . Talc is known to be toxic if it enters the abdominal cavity i.e. , via the vagina . Cornstarch is generally believed to be safe ; however , some researchers have raised concerns over its use as well .
Mogadishu has historically served as a media hub . In 1975 , the Somali Film Agency SFA , the nation 's film regulatory body , was established in Mogadishu .

The land assault was frustrated when the channel between the two islands was found to be too deep to wade , and the American defenses prevented an amphibious landing . The naval bombardment had little effect due to the sandy soil and the spongy nature of the fort 's palmetto log construction . Careful fire by the defenders wrought significant damage on the British fleet , which withdrew after an entire day 's bombardment . The British withdrew their expedition force to New York , and did not return to South Carolina until 1780 .

McNichol was born in Kilmarnock , Ayrshire . His father , Danny , died when he was five , so McNichol and seven siblings were raised by their mother , Catherine . He attended St Joseph 's School in Kilmarnock , and started work as a messenger boy for a local draper 's shop when he left school . His shop work stopped him playing football on Saturdays , but he was able to play some midweek football for Junior club Hurlford United . When he was taken on at the local bus garage as an apprentice motor mechanic , he became available on Saturdays as well . Hurlford paid him ten shillings a game , nearly as much as his apprentice 's wages . During the Second World War , McNichol was called up to the Fleet Air Arm as a mechanic , but was able to play friendly matches for Inverness - based club Clachnacuddin . Because of the number of professional players stationed around the country , such matches were played at a fairly high standard .
During the 1600s and 1700s , The Three Fires Confederacy controlled much of the area known as the hub of the Great Lakes , which included the Canadian shore where Sarnia is now located . During this time , it maintained relations with many of the First Nations , including Huron , Sioux , and Iroquois , as well as the countries of Great Britain and France . In fact , their trading partners , the Huron , welcomed La Salle and the Griffon in 1679 after he sailed into Lake Huron . The Ontario Heritage Trust erected a sign under the Blue Water Bridge in commemoration of the voyage , as shown by the photo of the sign .
American Beauty was released on VHS on May 9 , 2000 , and on DVD with the DTS format on October 24 , 2000 . Before the North American rental release on May 9 , Blockbuster Video wanted to purchase hundreds of thousands of extra copies for its guaranteed title range , whereby anyone who wanted to rent the film would be guaranteed a copy . Blockbuster and DreamWorks could not agree on a profit - sharing deal , so Blockbuster ordered two - thirds the number of copies it originally intended . DreamWorks made around one million copies available for rental ; Blockbuster 's share would usually have been about 400 , 000 of these . Some Blockbuster stores only displayed 60 copies , and others did not display the film at all , forcing customers to ask for it . The strategy required staff to read a statement to customers explaining the situation ; Blockbuster claimed it was only monitoring customer demand due to the reduced availability . Blockbuster 's strategy leaked before May 9 , leading to a 30 order increase from other retailers . In its first week of rental release , American Beauty made 6 . 8 million . This return was lower than would have been expected had DreamWorks and Blockbuster reached an agreement . In the same year , The Sixth Sense made 22 million , while Fight Club made 8 . 1 million , though the latter 's North American theatrical performance was just 29 that of American Beauty . Blockbuster 's strategy also affected rental fees ; American Beauty averaged 3 . 12 , compared with 3 . 40 for films that Blockbuster fully promoted . Only 53 of the film 's rentals were from large outlets in the first week , compared with the usual 65 .

The Mundo Perdido is to the west of the Plaza of the Seven Temples . It is the largest ceremonial complex dating from the Preclassic period at Tikal . The complex was organized as a large E - Group consisting of a pyramid aligned with a platform to the east that supported three temples . The Mundo Perdido complex was rebuilt many times over the course of its history . By AD 250 300 its architectural style was influenced by the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico , including the use of the talud - tablero form . During the Early Classic period c . 250 600 the Mundo Perdido became one of the twin foci of the city , the other being the North Acropolis .

The game 's world and characters were designed primarily by Gilbert . After having read Tim Powers ' historical fantasy novel On Stranger Tides , he decided to add paranormal themes to the game 's plot . He also cited Powers ' book as an influence on the characters , particularly those of Guybrush and LeChuck . Inspiration for the game 's ambiance came from Gilbert 's favorite childhood amusement park ride , Pirates of the Caribbean . Grossman said that Gilbert always wanted to step off the ride and talk to the people who lived in that world . Near the final stages of the design work , Gilbert introduced several characters who were not directly related to the game 's story . He considered this to be an important decision , as the player would need those seemingly minor characters in later parts of the game and would receive a chance to really interact with them .
Early in their development , T Tauri stars follow the Hayashi track they contract and decrease in luminosity while remaining at roughly the same temperature . Less massive T Tauri stars follow this track to the main sequence , while more massive stars turn onto the Henyey track .

While Rowley and Hamelin had sparred in the Indian Ocean , Corbet had made the lengthy journey back to Britain . During his time in command of Nereide , Corbet had already developed a reputation as a strict disciplinarian , regularly beating his men for the slightest infractions , to the extent that he had provoked a brief mutiny on Nereide in 1808 . His reputation spread before him , and when he switched commands with Captain Richard Raggett of HMS Africaine , he was met with a storm of protest from Africaine 's crew . Although none of the men aboard Africaine had served with Corbet before , his preference for brutal punishment was well known in the Navy and the crew sent a letter to the Admiralty insisting that they would not serve under him . Concerned at what they considered to be mutiny , the Admiralty sent three popular officers to Africaine with the message that if the protest was quietly dropped there would be no courts - martial for mutiny but if not , the entire crew would be liable to attack . To emphasise the threat , the frigate HMS Menelaus was brought alongside with her gunports open and her cannon ready to fire . Chastened , the crew of Africaine allowed Corbet aboard and the frigate sailed for the Indian Ocean a few days later , carrying instructions for the authorities at Madras to prepare an expeditionary force to invade Isle de France .

She was modified into a submarine salvage and rescue ship before being placed in reserve in 1928 . Asahi was recommissioned in late 1937 , after the start of the Second Sino - Japanese War , and used to transport Japanese troops . In 1938 , she was converted into a repair ship and based first at Japanese - occupied Shanghai , China , and then Cam Ranh Bay , French Indochina , from late 1938 to 1941 . The ship was transferred to occupied Singapore in early 1942 to repair a damaged light cruiser and ordered to return home in May .

The dorsal and pelvic fins are angular , with the first dorsal fin larger than the second . The pectoral fins are narrow , pointed , and falcate sickle - shaped ; their shape separates this species from the similar - looking nurse shark . The origin of the first dorsal fin is about even with the origin of the pelvic fins , while the origin of the anal fin is even with or somewhat behind the origin of the second dorsal fin . The caudal fin has a shallow upper lobe and barely present lower lobe , comprising about a quarter of the total length in adults . The dermal denticles are diamond - shaped , bearing 4 5 faint ridges radiating from a blunt point . Tawny nurse sharks are yellowish , reddish , or grayish brown above and off - white below , and are capable of slowly changing their color to better blend with the environment .

European traders had established outposts on the Indian subcontinent by the 17th century . Through overwhelming military strength , the British East India company subdued local kingdoms and established themselves as the dominant force by the 18th century . Following the Rebellion of 1857 , the Government of India Act 1858 led the British Crown to assume direct control of India . In the decades following , civic society gradually emerged across India , most notably the Indian National Congress Party , formed in 1885 . The period after World War I was marked by British reforms such as the Montagu Chelmsford Reforms , but it also witnessed the enactment of the repressive Rowlatt Act and calls for self - rule by Indian activists . The discontent of this period crystallized into nationwide non - violent movements of non - cooperation and civil disobedience , led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi .

After the invasion was over , the brigade was supposed to support the operation with bridging and infrastructure support . During the planning for the invasion , the engineers of the brigade were told that reconstruction in Iraq would be conducted by Department of Defense contractors and Iraqi civilians . They were not originally prepared to conduct major reconstruction efforts . When V Corps became the commanding element for the task force to rebuild Iraq , much of the invasion force , including the 130th Engineer Brigade , was sent to do jobs they had not been originally planned for , as basic utilities and sanitation conditions in Iraq were far below what was expected . Throughout the rest of 2003 and 2004 , the engineers engaged in a large number of initial reconstruction projects on basic utilities , including schools , water treatment plants , waste removal , and the nation 's power grid . It was determined that the scale of these projects was much greater than what the US had expected or what had been encountered in previous contingencies . It was also decided that reconstruction was essential to the coalition since it would help win over the Iraqi people . By May 2003 , the brigade had been completely repurposed . Though originally tasked with demolishing obstacles , building fortifications , and bridging operations , the brigade was tasked entirely with construction projects . This conversion was a difficult process , as the brigade did not have the equipment and specialist units designed to handle reconstruction on a national scale . As more US military reconstruction units arrived in Iraq , the brigade grew to eight battalions and three groups .

During the casting process , Keamy was described as a military type in his late - twenties who does not question orders . Chris Carabott of IGN wrote that in a show that features characters fraught with uncertainty , Keamy is the polar opposite and his Marine mentality definitely sets him apart . His team has a physical advantage and with the help of Mr. Widmore , they have a tactical advantage as well . Keamy is like a bulldog being thrown into a cage full of kittens except for Iraqi military torturer Sayid . Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post , stated that Keamy is Crazy ! out of all the bad guys on the Island past , present , and future Keamy has to be one of the most dangerous ones . Not because of how big he is , or the weaponry , but his willingness to kill at the drop of a hat . That doesn 't bode well for our Losties protagonists . Co - show runner executive producer writer Carlton Cuse has stated that he and the other writers create complex characters because they are interested in exploring how good and evil can be embodied in the same characters and the writers are also intrigued the struggles we all have , to overcome the dark parts of our souls ; however , he later clarified that there is an exception : Keamy 's bad , he knows he 's bad , but he 's ... a guy that does the job . Damon Lindelof stated that the great thing about Keamy is that he is like a ... merciless survivor . There ' s this great moment in the season finale where he just sort of hackie - sacks a grenade thrown at him over to where his ally Omar is standing . Omar is certainly an acceptable casualty as far as Keamy is concerned . According to a featurette in the Lost : The Complete Fourth Season The Expanded Experience DVD set , Keamy likes heavy weaponry and physical fitness and dislikes negotiations and doctors .
Starting with the delivery of the F - 28s and 737s , all planes were named after Norwegian kings . The last three F - 27s were also given such names . During the 1970s , Braathens SAFE took delivery of eleven 737s , supplementing the four F - 28s . The third delivered , LN - SUA , had a cargo door on the side , making it ideal for cargo flights . The three planes delivered in 1979 had extended range tanks making direct flights to the Canary Islands possible . In 1979 , the company started looking into possible replacements for their fleet , considering larger aircraft .

The main gameplay feature of Crush is the ability to transpose the layout of a level between 2D and 3D representations to reach seemingly inaccessible areas and solve the game 's puzzles . The player can switch the third - person camera between four directional side views and a top - down view at any time while in 3D . When in these views , the player can have Danny crush the level , collapsing all 3D elements into 2D ; crushing from side views results in a 2D platformer - like view , while crushing from the top - down view provides a 2D top - down perspective . Crushing can connect and merge platforms on the same visual plane in the 3D view but separated by a large distance , creating pathways across the level in the 2D view . The player can also uncrush the level at any time . Certain blocks , when crushed , become either obstacles through which Danny cannot pass , or ledges the player can use to reach other parts of the level . Attempts to crush a level in any manner that would harm Danny are thwarted . However , uncrushing can leave Danny in a helpless state , such as hanging in mid - air .

The International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN has assessed the tawny nurse shark as Vulnerable worldwide , as it faces heavy fishing pressure and its low reproductive and dispersal rates limit the ability of over - exploited populations to recover . Furthermore , this shark 's inshore habitat renders it susceptible to habitat degradation , destructive fishing practices e.g. poisons and explosives , especially prevalent off Indonesia and the Philippines , and human harassment . Localized declines or extirpations of the tawny nurse shark have been documented off India and Thailand . Off Australia , this species has been assessed as of Least Concern , as there it is not targeted by fisheries .

The character of Walter Skinner had evolved over the course of The X - Files ' sixth season . At the start of season six , however , the producers and writers felt that Skinner 's character was becoming expendable . With their transfer away from the X - Files division , Mulder and Scully saw less and less of their former boss . Originally , John Shiban , the writer of the episode , wanted to infect Mulder with nanobots . However , he decided that since the audience knew Mulder would not be killed , this plot would not be very effective . In order to compensate for this loss , Shiban decided to re - work Skinner back into the series mythology by putting him in Mulder 's place . Shiban , inspired by the 1950 noir film D.O.A. and its 1988 remake which he jokingly called two pretty bad movies , decided to craft an episode of The X - Files around the conceit of a guy who 's been poisoned and has only a short time to live and has to use that time to find out why and by whom he 's being murdered .

In 1930 the Meteorological Office no longer used the Cooke telescope , and agreed to donate it to the university if they would handle its removal . Both the telescope and the observatory dome were moved to the observatory building . The telescope moved once again in 1952 to the David Dunlap Observatory north of the city , and in 1984 it was donated to the Canada Science and Technology Museum . The Department of Surveying and Geodesy used the observatory until the 1950s . Since then the office areas have been used for a variety of purposes , including a police substation and a telephone switchboard . Renamed as the Louis Beaufort Stewart Observatory , the building was handed over to the Students ' Administrative Council now University of Toronto Students ' Union in 1953 , which has used the building since then . The dome , now unused , receives a yearly multi - colour paint job by engineering students .

As early as three years after independence , the Naga National Council called for a boycott of Independence Day in northeast India . Separatist protests in this region intensified in the 1980s ; calls for boycotts and terrorist attacks by insurgent organisations such as the United Liberation Front of Assam and the National Democratic Front of Bodoland , marred celebrations . With increasing insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir from the late 1980s , separatist protesters boycotted Independence Day there with bandh strikes , use of black flags and by flag burning . Terrorist outfits such as Lashkar - e - Taiba , the Hizbul Mujahideen and the Jaish - e - Mohammed have issued threats , and have carried out attacks around Independence Day . Boycotting of the celebration has also been advocated by insurgent Maoist rebel organisations .

Most microorganisms and plants can biosynthesize all 20 standard amino acids , while animals including humans must obtain some of the amino acids from the diet . The amino acids that an organism cannot synthesize on its own are referred to as essential amino acids . Key enzymes that synthesize certain amino acids are not present in animals such as aspartokinase , which catalyses the first step in the synthesis of lysine , methionine , and threonine from aspartate . If amino acids are present in the environment , microorganisms can conserve energy by taking up the amino acids from their surroundings and downregulating their biosynthetic pathways .

The Ming dynasty had seen considerable advancement in the process of colour printing in China . At his studio , Hu Zhengyan experimented with various forms of woodblock printing , creating processes for producing multi - coloured prints and embossed printed designs . As a result , he was able to produce some of China 's first printed publications in colour , using a block printing technique known as assorted block printing douban yinshua , . This system made use of multiple blocks , each carved with a different part of the final image and each bearing a different colour . It was a lengthy , painstaking process , requiring thirty to fifty engraved printing blocks and up to seventy inkings and impressions to create a single image . Hu also employed a related form of multiple - block printing called set - block printing taoban yinshua , , which had existed since the Yuan period some 200 years earlier but had only recently come into fashion again . He refined these block printing techniques by developing a process for wiping some of the ink off the blocks before printing ; this enabled him to achieve gradation and modulation of shades which were not previously possible .

 Criticism of Alan Dershowitz 's The Case for Israel 
Moorey was unconvinced the artifact was indeed a vase , mentioning that Selimkhanov , after his analysis of the Tello object published in 1975 , attempted to relate the metal to Transcaucasian natural antimony i.e. native metal and that the antimony objects from Transcaucasia are all small personal ornaments . This weakens the evidence for a lost art of rendering antimony malleable . 
The film is based on the concept of reincarnation and eternal love . According to Rediff , the rewritten script 's basic storyline is that Love remains eternal and it will follow generations and generations . There is always a big victory for Love . The film 's flashback sequences were used as a flip switch between the film 's olden and present day eras . Initially the film featured a scene in which the present day heroine accidentally receives a dupatta preserved in a museum that is used in the flashbacks as the dupatta Bhairava and Ranadheer race for . However , separate dupattas were used in the film as Rajamouli felt that getting the dupatta from the flashback would complicate the narrative .
On Independence Day and Republic Day , patriotic songs in Hindi and regional languages are broadcast on television and radio channels . They are also played alongside flag hoisting ceremonies . Patriotic films are broadcast .

Indian Postal Service publishes commemorative stamps depicting independence movement leaders , nationalistic themes and defence - related themes on 15 August .
In June 2009 , The Guardian released video evidence recorded by a FIT at the 2008 Climate Camp of alleged police brutality against two female members of Fitwatch . The women had asked police officers to reveal their shoulder numbers , as at least four officers had not displayed them . The women attempted to photograph the police officers for evidence , but were forced to the ground , restrained with handcuffs , and had their legs bound with straps . They were then placed in restraint positions , arrested , charged and held in custody for four days , including three days in HMP Bronzefield , before they were released on bail . The police later retracted all the charges against the women . The women lodged a complaint with the IPCC over the incident . The journalist George Monbiot commented on this case , saying that the police are turning activism into a crime and that the FITs ' methods appear to have been lifted from a Stasi training manual . He claimed that anybody who is politically active is filmed , identified , monitored , logged , and cross - checked . A police debrief into the operation at Kingsnorth praised the deployment of FITs saying that they were highly effective and gained good intelligence and disruption .
Immediately following the Soviet occupation of Lithuania , The Internationale replaced the Tauti ka giesm . When in 1944 ' The Internationale ' have been replaced by State Anthem of the Soviet Union in Soviet Union as official anthem , Tauti ka giesm was used as official anthem for the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic . An alternate anthem was created and introduced in 1950 . The music for that piece was composed by Balys Dvarionas and Jonas vedas , and the words were written originally by Antanas Venclova . Following Stalin 's death in 1953 , its lyrics were modified by Vacys Reimeris to remove reference to the former dictator . This anthem stated that Lenin had lit the path to freedom , helped by the Russian people , and exhorted the Lithuanian people to work with peoples of the other Soviet Republics . The anthem was confirmed in Article 169 of the 1978 Constitution of the Lithuanian SSR . The song continued to be used until Lithuania broke away from the Soviet Union . Already in 1988 , the Tauti ka giesm was suggested as a replacement for the Soviet Lithuanian anthem . After preliminary approval by the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR and successive legislative bodies , its status as the national anthem was reconfirmed in 1992 . In that year , the Constitution of Lithuania was approved ; Article 19 of the document states that Tauti ka giesm will be the national anthem of Lithuania . The last law in relation to the national anthem was passed in 1999 ; it contained the official lyrics and protocol on how and when to play the anthem .

For the next 2 . 5 miles 4 . 0 km , the route passes by open fields as it overlooks the lake to the east . The route gradually descends back into the valley as it heads further northward into the town of Fleming . Once in Fleming , NY 38 runs along the lakeshore and serves a long line of lakeside homes as it passes by a series of fields to the west . The amount of development along the route begins to increase at the northern end of the lake in the hamlet of Melrose Park , where NY 38 meets NY 437 by way of a traffic circle . At this point , NY 437 becomes the primary lakeside highway while NY 38 becomes a four - lane divided highway and heads northwest as Lake Avenue toward the city of Auburn .

As in the rest of the city , Barkaara Market 's real estate values have also risen considerably . As of 2013 , the local Tabaarak firm was renting out a newly constructed warehouse at the market for 2 , 000 per month .
After the charges were dropped , Gordon said that he wished to try to put all this , including the events of 21 years ago , behind me and try to return to my everyday life . However , the fact that the charges were dropped angered Carol 's brother , Ivor Price , who said that he was disgusted by the way that Carol was portrayed in the proceedings , and talked of how Carol was not someone who was cheap or had a string of lovers . 
This factor also worked in reverse ; while Hannah de Rothschild was keen to marry Rosebery , she was also aware of many obstacles , the foremost being that she was devoted to her faith , and to leave it would be a severe moral wrench . Another obstacle was the Rothschild family itself : it was their custom to marry cousins to keep their fortune within the family . Ironically , Hannah herself had opposed the marriage of her cousin Annie de Rothschild to the Christian Eliot Yorke , the son of the Earl of Hardwicke , in 1866 . In fact , she was to be the third daughter of the family 's English branch to marry outside of the Jewish faith , but such was the fame of the bridegroom and the resultant publicity that the Jewish elders and press felt an example needed to be made . The Jewish Chronicle announced its most poignant grief at the prospect , and cryptically added , If the flame seize on the cedars , how will fare the hyssop on the wall : if the leviathan is brought up with a hook , how will the minnows escape , demonstrating what a threat to the social fabric of the Jewish faith the Jewish elders saw in the prospect of such a marriage . The quotation , originally from the Babylonian Talmud , can be taken to mean that the elders and respected members and more notable members of the Jewish faith should set a good example by strictly following the teachings of the Jewish articles of faith which frown upon marriage to members of other religions .
The contemporary reviews of Ulysses were positive and found no irony in the poem . Author John Sterling like Tennyson a member of the Cambridge Apostles wrote in the Quarterly Review in 1842 , How superior is ' Ulysses ' ! There is in this work a delightful epic tone , and a clear impassioned wisdom quietly carving its sage words and graceful figures on pale but lasting marble . Tennyson 's 1842 volume of poetry impressed Scottish writer Thomas Carlyle . Quoting three lines of Ulysses in an 1842 letter to Tennyson 
On August 26 , a low - pressure area in the open Atlantic Ocean became sufficiently organized to be classified as a tropical cyclone . Moving slowly in a general west - northwest motion , the disturbance intensified , reaching tropical storm strength on August 28 and subsequently hurricane intensity on August 30 . The hurricane passed within 85 mi 135 km of Cape Hatteras before recurving towards the northeast . However , the hurricane continued to intensify , and reached peak intensity as a modern - day Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 110 mph 175 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of 961 mbar hPa ; 28 . 38 inHg , though these statistical peaks were achieved at different times on September 2 . Afterwards , the tropical cyclone began a weakening trend as it proceeded northward , and had degenerated into a tropical storm by the time it made its first landfall on Nova Scotia later that day . The storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone the next day while making another landfall on New Brunswick . The extratropical remnants persisted into Quebec before merging with a larger extratropical system late on September 3 .

 West End Girls was first released in April 1984 through writer and producer Bobby Orlando 's label . The song was a club hit in the United States , and in some European countries , such as Belgium , where it debuted at number 24 on the VRT Top 30 chart on 28 July 1984 , peaking at 17 four weeks later . In Canada , West End Girls first entered the RPM singles chart in April 1985 , reaching a peak position of 81 in June 1985 .
Temnospondyls ' vertebrae are divided into several segments . In living tetrapods , the main body of the vertebra is a single piece of bone called the centrum , but in temnospondyls , this region was divided into a pleurocentrum and intercentrum . Two types of vertebrae are recognized in temnospondyls : stereospondylous and rhachitomous vertebrae . In rhachitomous vertebrae , the intercentra are large and wedge - shaped , and the pleurocentra are relatively small blocks that fit between them . Both elements support a spine - like neural arch , and well - developed interlocking projections called zygapophyses strengthen the connections between vertebrae . The strong backbone and strong limbs of many ratchitomous temnospondyls allowed them to be partially , and in some cases fully , terrestrial . In stereospondylous vertebrae , the pleurocentra have been lost entirely , with the intercentra enlarged as the main body of the vertebrae . This weaker type of backbone indicates the stereospondylous temnospondyls spent more time in water .
Concluding the poem , the narrator argues that the figures should be treated as figures , and that he would not be misled by them :
While the first series was not as popular as its predecessor , the second series was more successful . It was broadcast during the winter months , from September to April , with Fully Booked replacing it during the summer . New episodes of the Rugrats were shown . The series went out opposite ITV 's What 's Up Doc ? but during its third series issues were raised by the ITC , and a number of people left including Don Austen and John Eccleston Bro and Bro 's puppeteers who defected to Live Kicking to star as a couple of leprechaun brothers Sage Onion .
In 2000 , the Cassini probe , en route to Saturn , flew by Jupiter and provided some of the highest - resolution images ever taken of the planet . It made its closest approach on December 30 , 2000 , and made many scientific measurements . About 26 , 000 images of Jupiter were taken during the months - long flyby . It produced the most detailed global color portrait of Jupiter yet , in which the smallest visible features are approximately 60 km 37 mi across .
Roxas is depicted as a spiky blond - haired teenager with blue eyes . As a civilian he wears a white jacket along with a black jacket and white trousers . As a member of Organization XIII , Roxas wears a black coat that covers most of his body including his hood along with the other members . His weapon is the Keyblade known as Kingdom Key , Kingudamu Ch n , Kingdom Chain , resembling a classic skeleton key , with a long silver keychain extending from the hilt , and a Mickey Mouse token on the end of the keychain , but the player is able to modify it during Kingdom Hearts 358 2 Days using different keychains . Roxas also becomes able to dual - wield Keyblades after leaving the Organization , and exclusively uses the Oathkeeper , Yakusoku no Omamori , lit . Oath 's Charm , whose shaft displays two hearts , and its handle bears two angel wings , and the Oblivion , Sugisarishi Omoide , lit . Passing Memories .
Rebecca Gore used their exposure to European country estates to design a lavish new building for their Waltham estate during their English sojourn . Designed with the assistance of French architect Joseph - Guillaume Legrand and probably also influenced by the works of English architect Sir John Soane , the house that was built upon their return to the United States in 1804 now known as Gore Place is one of the finest extant examples of Federalist architecture .
The royal prerogative has been called a notoriously difficult concept to define adequately , but whether a particular type of prerogative power exists is a matter of common law to be decided by the courts as the final arbiter . A prominent constitutional theorist , A. V. Dicey , proposed in the nineteenth century that :
In the United States , fire and hot liquids are the most common causes of burns . Of house fires that result in death , smoking causes 25 and heating devices cause 22 . Almost half of injuries are due to efforts to fight a fire . Scalding is caused by hot liquids or gases and most commonly occurs from exposure to hot drinks , high temperature tap water in baths or showers , hot cooking oil , or steam . Scald injuries are most common in children under the age of five and , in the United States and Australia , this population makes up about two - thirds of all burns . Contact with hot objects is the cause of about 20 - 30 of burns in children . Generally , scalds are first- or second - degree burns , but third - degree burns may also result , especially with prolonged contact . Fireworks are a common cause of burns during holiday seasons in many countries . This is a particular risk for adolescent males .
He was convicted of assaulting a police officer and of using threatening , abusive or insulting words or behaviour in April 2006 . As a result , he had his boxing licence suspended for five months by the British Boxing Board of Control , despite the incident happening before he was under the BBBofC 's jurisdiction . Woodhouse returned to football in November 2006 , joining Rushden Diamonds in the Conference National before moving to Mansfield Town in January 2009 . After leaving them , he moved to Harrogate Town . At the end of February 2010 , he joined Sheffield in the Northern Premier League . Before the start of the 2011 12 football season , he moved up two divisions in the football league system when he joined Conference North outfit Eastwood Town .
Hugh Foliot c . 1155 1234 was a medieval Bishop of Hereford . Related somehow to his predecessor at Hereford , he served as a priest and papal judge as well as being an unsuccessful candidate as Bishop of St David 's in Wales . In 1219 , he was appointed Bishop of Hereford . During his time in office , he mostly attended to ecclesiastical duties , but did occasionally serve as a royal administrator . He helped found a hospital and a priory , and died in 1234 after a months - long illness .
The IJN then decided to use the sisters and their escorts to bring a load of petrol , rubber , tin and other strategic minerals back to Japan after the American carriers departed the South China Sea Operation Kita . They loaded their cargoes beginning on 6 February at Singapore and departed four days later . Also carrying some 1 , 150 oilfield workers , they were escorted by yodo and three destroyers . Decrypted Japanese radio signals revealed the Japanese plan to the Allies , and 15 submarines were positioned along their anticipated route in an attempt to intercept and sink the ships . An additional 11 were moved into position while the group was en route , but only three were ultimately able to attack . None of them were successful before the Japanese reached Kure on 20 February . The Fourth Carrier Division was disbanded on 1 March and the sisters were reduced to 1st rank reserve ships . On 19 March Kure was attacked by aircraft from Task Force 58 and Hy ga was hit three times by bombs that killed 37 men and wounded 52 . Her gunners claimed to have shot down one American dive bomber during the attack . Ise was hit twice during the attack , but her casualties , if any , are unknown .
The Michigan State Highway Department MSHD changed the routings and designations of the highways around Cooks , Thompson and Manistique in the mid - 1930s . The agency rerouted US 2 between Cooks and M 149 in Thompson , turning the old road back to county control . The section between M 149 and M 125 was redesignated as an extension of M 149 to Thompson , and M 125 was replaced by a further extension of M 149 . The last change was to route US 2 along its current alignment in the area , completing the changes on August 2 , 1936 .
His place in Roman history is therefore summarized as a necessary , if tumultuous stop - gap before the Trajanic - Antonine dynasties . It is a fact of irony that even the only major public work completed during his reign , the Forum of Nerva , ultimately became known as the Forum Transitorium , or transitional forum .
As early as 1978 , the musical was considered as the basis for a movie . After a nearly 20 - year production delay , Madonna was cast in the title role for the 1996 film version and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy . In response to the American film , and in an alleged attempt to offer a more politically accurate depiction of Evita 's life , an Argentine film company released Eva Per n : The True Story . The Argentine production starred actress Esther Goris in the title role . This movie was the 1996 Argentine submission for the Oscar in the category of Best Foreign Language Film . 
Nathan continued as the Twins ' closer for the 2007 season . He had a stretch between July and August where he gave up just two earned runs and converted all 12 save chances . Once again despite Nathan 's numbers , he was not picked for the All - Star team . Nathan finished the year by converting 37 of 41 save opportunities with a record of 4 2 and an ERA of 1 . 88 . The Twins however had a disappointing season and missed the playoffs .
Armenian language . In the Armenian community in Tbilisi , the Georgian script was occasionally used for writing Armenian in the 18th and 19th centuries , and some samples of this kind of texts are kept at the Georgian National Center of Manuscripts in Tbilisi .

The verdict may have been appealed by the Supreme State Attorney SSA to the Supreme Court . As the appeal hasn 't been lodged by SSA within two months of the delivery of written second instance verdict , it has become final .
People have lived in Ireland for over 9 , 000 years . The different eras are termed mesolithic , neolithic , Bronze Age , and Iron Age .
Iguanodon was recorded from Africa based on teeth from Tunisia and elsewhere in the Sahara , but the description of Lurdusaurus and Ouranosaurus cast doubt on African records of Iguanodon . The genus was also recorded from Mongolia based on the description of I. orientalis , and in North America based on I. ottingeri from Utah . Another North American species , from South Dakota , once assigned to Iguanodon as I. lakotaensis , has since been reclassified as the genus Dakotadon .
On July 17 , 2012 , Prague Municipal Court 's panel of three judges headed by judge Lubo Vrba overturned the bail decision by doubling the bail amount to CZK 8 million US 400 , 000 . After this , the State Attorney challenged the conditions of release , trying to achieve that the bail is subject to Blythe staying in the country and or Blythe having to report at a given police station regularly until the criminal proceedings are finished . On August 2 , 2012 , the appellate court rejected the State Attorney 's second complaint and ordered Blythe 's immediate release . Blythe left the Czech Republic the next day , claiming in an interview with TV Nova that he would return for the trial .

Annie Kenney , born in nearby Springhead , and who worked in Oldham 's cotton mills , was a notable member of the Suffragette movement credited with sparking off suffragette militancy when she heckled Winston Churchill , and later with Emmeline Pankhurst the first Suffragist to be imprisoned . Oldham Women 's Suffrage Society was established in 1910 with Margery Lees as president and quickly joined the Manchester and District Federation of the National Union of Women 's Suffrage Societies . The Chartist and Co - operative movements had strong support in the town , whilst many Oldhamers protested against the emancipation of slaves . The Riot Act was read in 1852 on election day following a mass public brawl over the Reform Act , and irregularities with parliamentary candidate nominations .
The female may be offered food by the male during courtship . He has a brief courtship display in which the neck is extended and the head held down , the tail is fanned , and the wings are spread with the tips touching the ground . He will then attempt to approach the female from behind , and then leap on her back to copulate . The nest is typically in grassland , sometimes in safer sites along a hedge , or near an isolated tree or bush , or in overgrown vegetation . Where grass is not tall enough at the start of the season , the first nest may be constructed in herby or marsh vegetation , with the second brood in hay . The second nest may also be at a higher altitude that the first , to take advantage of the later - developing grasses further up a hill . The nest , well hidden in the grass , is built in a scrape or hollow in the ground . It is made of woven coarse dry grass and other plants , and lined with finer grasses . Although nest construction is usually described as undertaken by the female , a recent aviary study found that in the captive population the male always built the nest .

From the 4th century through the 18th and early 19th centuries , the Languedoc had a reputation for producing high quality wine . In Paris during the 14th century , wines from the St. Chinian area were prescribed in hospitals for their healing powers . During the advent of the Industrial Age in the late 19th century , production shifted towards mass - produced le gros rouge cheap red wine that could satisfy the growing work force . The use of highly prolific grape varieties produced high yields and thin wines , which were normally blended with red wine from Algeria to give them more body .

At the 2011 World Cup , Wales reached the tournament semi - finals for the first time since 1987 where they lost 9 8 to France after a red card for captain Sam Warburton . The two teams met again in March 2012 , where Wales needed a win to claim their third Six Nations Grand Slam in eight years , which they did with a 16 9 victory . This was followed immediately by an eight - match losing streak , which was eventually broken during the 2013 Six Nations , where Wales retained the Championship for the first time since 1979 wins . Wales reached the quarter - finals of the 2015 World Cup at the expense of hosts England , then lost 23 19 to South Africa .
Over the next week the 766th Regiment and the KPA 's 5th Division continued in a slow advance south as it met increasing South Korean resistance . United Nations air support began to increase , slowing the advance further . The force continued to occupy the eastern flank , and by July 24 it was advancing from the Chongsong - Andong region and approaching Pohang . On its flank was the KPA 's 12th Division . Progress halted as UN aerial and naval bombardment made movement more difficult . At the same time the North Korean units ' supply lines were stretched thin and began to break down , forcing them to conscript South Korean civilians to carry supplies .
The Cape lobster was first described by Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Herbst in 1792 as Cancer Astacus capensis . It was independently described in 1793 by Johan Christian Fabricius as Astacus flavus , possibly based on the same type specimen . When Friedrich Weber erected the genus Homarus in 1795 , he included Fabricius ' species in it , but this placement was not followed by later authors . The species reached its current classification in 1995 , when the monotypic genus Homarinus was erected by Irv Kornfield , Austin B. Williams and Robert S. Steneck .
On December 20 , 1915 , the first demonstration in Bel m took place at the Theatro Politheama . The O Tempo newspaper announced the event , stating that Conde Koma would show the main jiu - jitsu techniques , excepting the prohibited ones . He would also demonstrate self - defense techniques . After that , the troupe would be accepting challenges from the crowd , and there would be the first sensational match of jiu - jitsu between Shimitsu champion of Argentina and Laku Peruvian military professor . On December 22 , 1915 , according to O Tempo , jiu - jitsu world champion Maeda , head of the Japanese troupe , and Satake , New York champion , performed an enthusiastic and sensational jiu - jitsu match . On the same day , Nagib Assef , an Australian Greco - Roman wrestling champion of Turkish origin , challenged Maeda . On December 24 , 1915 , Maeda defeated in seconds the boxer Barbadiano Adolpho Corbiniano , who became one of his disciples . On January 3 , 1916 at Theatro Politheama , Maeda finally fought Nagib Assef , who was thrown off the stage and pinned into submission by arm - lock . On January 8 , 1916 , Maeda , Okura , and Shimitsu boarded the SS Antony and left for Liverpool . Tokugoro Ito went to Los Angeles . Satake and Laku stayed in Manaus teaching , according to O Tempo , jiu - jitsu . After 15 years together , Maeda and Satake had finally split up . Of this last trip , little is known . Maeda went from England to Portugal , Spain , and France , coming back to Brazil in 1917 alone . Settling in Bel m do Par , Maeda married D. May Iris .

Mole crickets stridulate like other crickets by scraping the rear edge of the left forewing , which forms a plectrum , against the lower surface of the right forewing , which has a ratchet - like series of asymmetric teeth : the more acute edges face backwards , as do those of the plectrum . The plectrum can move forwards with little resistance ; but moving it backwards makes it catch each tooth , setting up a vibration in both wings . The sound - producing stroke is the raising levation of the wings . The resulting song resembles the result of modulating a pure tone with a 66 Hertz wave to form regular chirps . In G. vineae , the wing levator muscle , which weighs 50 milligrams , can deliver 3 . 5 milliWatts of mechanical power ; G. gryllotalpa can deliver about 1 milliWatt . G. vineae produces an exceptionally loud song from half an hour after sunset , continuing for an hour ; it can be heard up to 600 metres away . At a distance of 1 metre from the burrow , the sound has a mean power over the stridulation cycle of up to 88 decibels ; the loudest recorded peak power was about 92 decibels ; at the mouths of the burrow , the sound reaches around 115 decibels . G. gryllotalpa can deliver a peak sound pressure of 72 decibels and a mean of about 66 decibels . The throat of the horn appears to be tuned offering low inductive reactance , making the burrow radiate sound efficiently ; the efficiency increases when the burrow is wet and absorbs less sound . Mole crickets are the only insects that construct a sound - producing apparatus . Given the known sensitivity of a cricket 's hearing 60 decibels , a night - flying G. vineae female should be able to detect the male 's song at a range of 30 metres ; this compares to about 5 metres for a typical Gryllus cricket that does not construct a burrow .
The series ' next band - centric title , Guitar Hero : Metallica , was released on March 29 , 2009 . Guitar Hero : Metallica is based on the full band experience of World Tour while offering similar features on Metallica 's history and music as found in Guitar Hero : Aerosmith . In addition , Metallica 's album , Death Magnetic , was available as downloadable content for Guitar Hero III simultaneously with the release of the album , with the content being forward - compatible with Guitar Hero World Tour and Guitar Hero : Metallica . Since the PlayStation 2 version does not support downloading , three extra songs were included from Death Magnetic and are as follows : Broken , Beat , and Scarred , Cyanide , and My Apocalypse . A new feature in the game , where the drummer can access a mode called Expert , has also been added . Expert mode was implemented to allow faster bass pedal beats , fast to the point where it would normally be out of the playable range of a single bass pedal , and was intended for a dual bass pedal .
The figure is clearly identifiable as a pope from his clothing . It seems trapped and isolated within the outlines of an abstract three - dimensional glass cage . This framing device , described by Sylvester as a space - frame , was to feature heavily throughout the artist 's career . A cord hangs from the upper edge of the glass case , falling just in front of the pope 's face and partially covering his eyes . It is too indistinctly drawn to identify with certainty , but given the presence of similar objects in Bacon 's later works , may be either the end of a hanging light switch or the tassel of a curtain ; the hanging cord was to become a signature for the artist . Apart from its symbolic meaning , it has a compositional function , framing the painting with a further set of vertical lines . Such an object reappears most prominently in the centre panel of his 1973 Triptych , May June 1973 , where it is clearly a dangling light bulb . For Bacon , these elements were intended to make the figure waver in and out of sight for the viewer , alluding to the fact that bulbs can be on or off , curtains open or closed .
God of War and God of War II were ported by Bluepoint Games and feature high - definition 720p anti - aliased graphics at 60 frames per second and Trophies . The bonus materials of the original two - disc PlayStation 2 version of God of War II are included with the Blu - ray version of the collection . The port was produced as a result of feedback from fans of the series and was viewed as a means of introducing new players to the series before God of War III was released . The God of War III game demo from E3 2009 was included with early copies of the collection . Sanzaru Games was responsible for porting the collection to the Vita .
Many people are opposed to single sentence spacing for various reasons . Some state that the habit of double spacing is too deeply ingrained to change . Others claim that additional space between sentences improves the aesthetics or readability of text . Proponents of double sentence spacing also state that some publishers may still require double - spaced manuscript submissions from authors . A key example noted is the screenwriting industry 's monospaced standard for screenplay manuscripts , Courier , 12 - point font , although some works on screenwriting indicate that Courier is merely preferred proportional fonts may be used . Some reliable sources state simply that writers should follow their particular style guide , but proponents of double spacing caution that publishers ' guidance takes precedence , including those that ask for double sentence spaced manuscripts .
Stansfield suffered from persistent abdominal pain in the early part of 2010 , and was admitted to hospital for tests at the end of March . On 8 April 2010 , Exeter City confirmed to the media that he had been diagnosed with a form of colorectal cancer . Manager Paul Tisdale told local news programme BBC Spotlight that there 's little good on this subject , but if there 's someone who can deal with it and meet it head on with real purpose , Adam 's the man .
A grand jury investigation led by Turner brought charges of widespread immigration fraud against members of Rajneeshpuram . Wiretapping crimes were discovered after Ma Anand Sheela had fled the commune in September 1985 . In December 1985 , 21 followers of Rajneesh were indicted on wiretapping charges .
The most likely cause of collapse at Tikal is overpopulation and agrarian failure . The fall of Tikal was a blow to the heart of Classic Maya civilization , the city having been at the forefront of courtly life , art and architecture for over a thousand years , with an ancient ruling dynasty . However , new research regarding paleoenvironmental proxies from the Tikal reservoir system suggests that a meteorological drought may have led to the abandonment of Tikal .
By November 1936 , enough debt had accumulated that a bondholder 's protective committee foreclosed on the property , buying it back for 750 , 000 . The Temple Methodist congregation lost its investment and was asked to leave . The Skinner Opus pipe organ was removed to be sold to Occidental College in Los Angeles and rebuilt in their Thorne Hall . The three - piece stained glass window was removed and exhibited , eventually making its way to Stockton , California where it was installed in the Morris Chapel at the University of the Pacific . The 100 McAllister building itself was refurbished : the church 's floor area was given over to parking , a coffee shop was built in part of the first floor lobby and the new enterprise opened again as the Empire Hotel , noted for completing , in 1938 , the first view lounge in the area , the Sky Room on the 24th floor . With plush carpeting , a large Art Deco - style oval bar , and plate glass windows on all sides , the Sky Room provided a panoramic view of the city . Architect Engineer wrote of the luxurious bar in April , 1938 , that it has no prototype west of New York , referring to Manhattan 's Rainbow Room which opened three - and - a - half years earlier .
20 to 50 of individuals with intestinal involvement also exhibit cardiac involvement . Up to 10 of chronically infected individuals develop neuritis that results in altered tendon reflexes and sensory impairment . Isolated cases exhibit central nervous system involvement , including dementia , confusion , chronic encephalopathy and sensory and motor deficits .
Within the Solar System , the nucleon fraction of xenon is 1 . 56 10 8 , for an abundance of approximately one part in 630 thousand of the total mass . Xenon is relatively rare in the Sun 's atmosphere , on Earth , and in asteroids and comets . The planet Jupiter has an unusually high abundance of xenon in its atmosphere ; about 2 . 6 times as much as the Sun . This high abundance remains unexplained and may have been caused by an early and rapid buildup of planetesimals small , subplanetary bodies before the presolar disk began to heat up . Otherwise , xenon would not have been trapped in the planetesimal ices . The problem of the low terrestrial xenon may potentially be explained by covalent bonding of xenon to oxygen within quartz , hence reducing the outgassing of xenon into the atmosphere .
The Fastra II 's predecessor , the Fastra I , has 4 dual - GPU GeForce 9800 GX2 video cards , for a total of 8 GPUs . At that time , the ASTRA group needed a motherboard that had four PCI Express x16 slots with double - spacing between each of them . The only such motherboard the ASTRA group could find at that time was the MSI K9A2 Platinum , which has four such slots . In 2009 , the Asus P6T7 WS Supercomputer motherboard , which the Fastra II uses , was released , which has seven PCI Express x16 slots . The Fastra II has six faster dual - GPU GeForce GTX 295 video cards , and a single - GPU GeForce GTX 275 , for a total of 13 GPUs . In the Fastra II , the GPUs mainly perform tomographic reconstruction . The technique which allows GPUs to perform general - purpose tasks like this outside of gaming , instead of CPUs , is called GPGPU , general - purpose computing on graphics processing units .

Innis laid the basis for scholarship that looked at the social sciences from a distinctly Canadian point of view . As the head of the University of Toronto 's political economy department , he worked to build up a cadre of Canadian scholars so that universities would not continue to rely as heavily on British or American - trained professors unfamiliar with Canada 's history and culture . He was successful in establishing sources of financing for Canadian scholarly research .

Thomas Quiney was born in Stratford - upon - Avon and baptised on 26 February 1589 in Holy Trinity Church . He was the son of Richard and Elizabeth Quiney . He had 10 siblings , among them a Richard Quiney who was a grocer in London , Mary Quiney who later married Richard Watts , the vicar of Harbury , and Elizabeth Quiney who married William Chandler . There is no record of Thomas Quiney 's attendance at the local school , but he had sufficient education to write short passages in French , run a business , and hold several municipal offices in his life .
 Mothers of the Disappeared runs for 5 : 14 5 minutes , 14 seconds . It is played in common time in a key of A. The song begins with the sound of rain hitting a roof , which fades in over the first fourteen seconds alongside the bass and a processed drum loop beat by Mullen which reverberates in the background . Thirty - two seconds into the song , Mullen 's drums enter , playing a sporadic beat every four to five seconds . At the fifty - second mark the drums play a more regular beat , and the Edge 's guitar , accompanied by Eno 's synthesizer , enters . The first verse begins at 1 : 28 , and introduces the chord progression of A5 E5 F m D A5 , which is played in the verses . At 2 : 41 Eno 's keyboards enter , and the song begins to follow a D D5 A5 chord progression , while Bono begins falsetto vocals . The second verse then begins at 3 : 01 . The lyrics end at 3 : 37 , and the song returns to the chord progression of D D5 A5 . The harmony gradually grows in volume until 4 : 33 , at which point the song enters into a coda ; the keyboards come to a finish and the guitar returns to playing A notes before fading over the next eight seconds alongside the bass . The synthesizer , drums , and drum loop conclude the song , fading out slowly over the last thirty - one seconds .
In turn , both Gwendolen and Cecily have the ideal of marrying a man named Ernest , a popular and respected name at the time . Gwendolen , quite unlike her mother 's methodical analysis of John Worthing 's suitability as a husband , places her entire faith in a Christian name , declaring in Act I , The only really safe name is Ernest . This is an opinion shared by Cecily in Act II , I pity any poor married woman whose husband is not called Ernest and they indignantly declare that they have been deceived when they find out the men 's real names .
Frogs and all other living tetrapods have a rod - like bone called the stapes that aids in hearing by transferring vibrations from the ear drum or homologous tympanum to the inner ear . Temnospondyls also have a stapes , which projects into the otic cavity . The stapes likely evolved from the hyomandibula of lobe - finned fishes . The positioning of the stapes and the shape of the otic region suggests that the tympani of temnospondyls and frogs are homologous , but the tympani of these amphibians are no longer considered homologous with the hearing systems of reptiles , birds , and mammals . Therefore , ear structures in temnospondyls were not ancestral to those of all other tetrapods .
The film is set in 2034 , two years after the events of 2nd GIG . Togusa is now the team leader for Public Security Section 9 , which has increased considerably in size .

Alkan grew up in a religiously observant Jewish household . His grandfather Marix Morhange had been a printer of the Talmud in Metz , and was probably a melamed Hebrew teacher in the Jewish congregation at Paris . Alkan 's widespread reputation as a student of the Old Testament and religion , and the high quality of his Hebrew handwriting testify to his knowledge of the religion , and many of his habits indicate that he practised at least some of its obligations , such as maintaining the laws of kashrut . Alkan was regarded by the Paris Consistory , the central Jewish organisation of the city , as an authority on Jewish music . In 1845 he assisted the Consistory in evaluating the musical ability of Samuel Naumbourg , who was subsequently appointed as hazzan cantor of the main Paris synagogue ; and he later contributed choral pieces in each of Naumbourg 's collections of synagogue music 1847 and 1856 . Alkan was appointed organist at the Synagogue de Nazareth in 1851 , although he resigned the post almost immediately for artistic reasons .
Using the stellar spectrum , astronomers can also determine the surface temperature , surface gravity , metallicity and rotational velocity of a star . If the distance of the star is found , such as by measuring the parallax , then the luminosity of the star can be derived . The mass , radius , surface gravity , and rotation period can then be estimated based on stellar models . Mass can be calculated for stars in binary systems by measuring their orbital velocities and distances . Gravitational microlensing has been used to measure the mass of a single star . With these parameters , astronomers can also estimate the age of the star .
Several wrestlers were concerned with Kurt Angle 's health going into his Slammiversary match with A.J. Styles . Despite the concerns , Angle appeared to be out of it after the contest but was expected to be alright .

The 1st Brigade was on the opposite flank to the 3rd Brigade and already getting involved in battles of its own , when its commander , Colonel Percy Owen , received a request from Maclagen for reinforcements . Owen sent two companies from the 3rd Battalion and one from the 1st Battalion Swannell 's to support the 3rd Brigade .
The new VIII Corps , under the overall command of douard Mortier , included three infantry divisions and a division of cavalry see Order of Battle below . Corps Mortier , as it was known , crossed the Danube at Linz and Passau in early November 1805 and marched east , on the north bank of the Danube . Operating independently , the corp 's cavalry conducted reconnaissance ahead of them and on the flanks . Gen. Gazan 's division about 6 , 000 men took the lead ; Mortier was with them . They were followed by Gen. Dupont 's division another 4 , 000 about one day 's march behind . Jean - Baptiste Dumonceau 's division another 4 , 000 , marching another day behind Dupont , brought up the rear . A flotilla of 50 boats acquired at Passau provided communications across the Danube . Before sending Mortier on his mission , Napoleon instructed him to protect his north flank at all times against possible Russian reinforcements , advice he reiterated in subsequent written orders . Napoleon also advised Mortier to secure all crossings of the Danube between Linz and Vienna .
Jifna is governed by a village council consisting of ten members including the chairman . The council was founded in 1954 , when a prominent resident , Nasri Ilias Samara , pressured the Jordanian authorities to recognize the institution , even though a village was normally required to have a population of at least 1 , 000 inhabitants for permission to establish a village council . The decision was approved by Jordan 's then prime minister . Representatives from Jifna 's largest families formed the original council 's body , appointing Smara as chairman and Salim Issa Musleh as vice chairman . Jabi Na 'im Kamil was elected as the chairman in 2005 and the Badil Alternative list which represents a leftist alliance of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Palestinian People 's Party won most of the council seats .
Chess playing programs HiTech and Deep Thought defeated chess masters in 1989 . Both were developed by Carnegie Mellon University ; Deep Thought development paved the way for the Deep Blue .
The Stockholm drawing contains a narrow blank gap to the right of the bishop with a few indistinct lines that could represent the lower profile of the kneeling figure of Saint Catherine . Although none of the faces in the three surviving panels match any in the drawing , a 1971 reconstruction by art historian John Ward which combined all of the works into a composition of a central Virgin and Child flanked by six saints is widely accepted . The Stockholm drawing 's original location or history before the 19th century is unknown , except that the verso shows a surviving carving of the Virgin and Child attributed to a Brussels workshop from about 1440 . This carving is also now in Portugal .
 Later years and legacy 
In 2003 the congregation got a permit to begin construction of a new facility on the now - vacant 1 . 37 - acre 0 . 55 ha plot of land at the northwest corner of East 29th Avenue and University Street . An initial capital campaign raised more than 1 . 8 million , which fully paid for the land , and by August 2007 an additional 1 . 7 million had been raised towards anticipated overall project costs of 5 million .
 Day 1 of the trial 
Keats realized that he could never have Love , could not fulfil his Ambition , and could not spend his time with Poesy . The conclusion of Ode to Indolence is a dismissal of both the images and his poetry as figures that would only mislead him . Even indolence itself seems unattainable ; Andrew Motion writes that the figures force Keats to regard indolence as the privilege of the leisured class to which he did not belong . If the poem is read as the final poem in the 1819 ode series , Ode on Indolence suggests that Keats is resigned to giving up his career as a poet because poetry cannot give him the immortality he wanted from it . Ironically , the poem provided Keats with such immortality . Besides the biographical component , the poem also describes Keats 's belief that his works should capture the beauty of art while acknowledging the harshness of life . In this way , the poems as a group capture Keats 's philosophy of negative capability , the concept of living with unreconciled contradictory views , by trying to reconcile Keats 's desire to write poetry and his inability to do so by abandoning poetry altogether and accepting life as it is .
Throughout World War II , condoms were not only distributed to male U.S. military members , but also heavily promoted with films , posters , and lectures . European and Asian militaries on both sides of the conflict also provided condoms to their troops throughout the war , even Germany which outlawed all civilian use of condoms in 1941 . In part because condoms were readily available , soldiers found a number of non - sexual uses for the devices , many of which continue to this day .
After World War II , Croatia became a one - party Socialist federal unit of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . Croatia was ruled by the Communists and enjoyed a degree of autonomy within the Yugoslav federation . In 1967 , a group of Croatian authors and linguists published the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language , demanding greater autonomy for the Croatian language . The declaration contributed to a national movement seeking greater civil rights and decentralization of the Yugoslav economy , culminating in the Croatian Spring of 1971 , which was suppressed by Yugoslav leadership . The 1974 Yugoslav Constitution gave increased autonomy to federal units , essentially fulfilling a goal of the Croatian Spring and providing a legal basis for independence of the federative constituents .
The 2003 Pacific typhoon season was a slightly below average yearlong period of tropical cyclogenesis exhibiting the development of 31 tropical depressions , of which 21 became named storms ; of those , 14 became typhoons . Though every month with the exception of February and March featured tropical activity , most storms developed from May through October . During the season , tropical cyclones affected the Philippines , Japan , China , the Korean Peninsula , Indochina , and various islands in the western Pacific .
After releasing three albums on Jive Records , Hed PE left the label to record independently , eventually signing with Suburban Noize Records in 2006 . Since 2006 , the band has become known for its involvement in the 9 11 Truth movement , referencing it in many of their song lyrics and concerts , as well as the concept of the album New World Orphans . To date , they have released nine studio albums , one live album and two compilation albums .
Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO won the account for Guinness in 1996 with a campaign built on their new strapline Good things come to those who wait . They produced several commercials using variations on the theme , including Swimblack , Bet on Black , and the critically acclaimed Surfer , voted the Best Advert of All Time by the British public in 2002 . After the 2001 Dreamer advertisements , Diageo , the corporate owners of Guinness , decided to pursue a more pan - European marketing strategy . The strapline proved difficult to translate , and was abandoned . Several new straplines were tried out over the next three years , including Believe Free and Tom Crean and A story of darkness and light Moth and Mustang .

The same idea of using a DAG to represent a family of paths occurs in the binary decision diagram , a DAG - based data structure for representing binary functions . In a binary decision diagram , each non - sink vertex is labeled by the name of a binary variable , and each sink and each edge is labeled by a 0 or 1 . The function value for any truth assignment to the variables is the value at the sink found by following a path , starting from the single source vertex , that at each non - sink vertex follows the outgoing edge labeled with the value of that vertex 's variable . Just as directed acyclic word graphs can be viewed as a compressed form of tries , binary decision diagrams can be viewed as compressed forms of decision trees that save space by allowing paths to rejoin when they agree on the results of all remaining decisions .
The tawny nurse shark was first described by French naturalist Ren - Primev re Lesson as Scyllium ferrugineum , based on a 1 . 4 m 4 ft 7 in long specimen from New Guinea . His short account was published in 1831 in Voyage au tour du monde , sur la corvette La Coquille . A more detailed description , along with an illustration , was published by German naturalist Eduard R ppell in 1837 as Nebrius concolor , based on a specimen from the Red Sea . Both names were retained , often in separate genera Ginglymostoma and Nebrius respectively , until they were synonymized by Leonard Compagno in 1984 . Compagno recognized that the tooth shape differences used to separate these species were the result of differences in age , with N. concolor representing younger individuals .
It was initially believed that Abby would affect Jamaica with gale force winds and heavy rainfall , and the U.S. Weather Bureau noted that interests on the island should monitor the progress of the storm . However , Abby remained far south of the island , and the impact it had on the island , if any , is unknown . Citizens of the Cayman Islands , Central America , and the Yucatan Peninsula were also to remain on alert during the passage of Abby . The U.S. Weather Bureau later warned citizens in British Honduras and Honduras to take all precautions for the protection of life and property against dangerous winds and abnormally high seas .

Richmond 's father bought an Eagle Indy Car chassis and an Offenhauser engine for the 1979 race at Michigan International Speedway . Richmond qualified 21st fastest with a 175 . 768 mph 282 . 871 km h lap , significantly slower than Bobby Unser 's 203 . 879 mph 328 . 111 km h pole position speed . The race ended for him when his motor blew up on the fourth lap , and he finished last 23rd . Owner Pat Santello was looking for a driver to replace Larry Rice for his CART team at the following race at Watkins Glen International , so he gave Richmond a test at Willow Spring where he had previously set the student record . Santello hired Richmond , who then qualified 15th fastest for the event and finished in eighth place , the best of his IndyCar career . Richmond raced in three more events that season .
Staley met guitarist Jerry Cantrell while working with Alice N ' Chains at Music Bank rehearsal studios . The two struggling musicians became roommates , living in a rehearsal space they shared . Alice N ' Chains soon disbanded , and Staley joined a funk band that also required a guitarist at the time . Staley asked Cantrell to join as a sideman . Cantrell agreed on condition that Staley join Cantrell 's band , which at the time included drummer Sean Kinney and bassist Mike Starr . Eventually the funk project broke up , and in 1987 Staley joined Cantrell 's band on a full - time basis , playing in clubs around the Pacific Northwest , often stretching 15 minutes of material into a 45 - minute set . The band played a couple of gigs , calling themselves different monikers , including Diamond Lie , the name of Cantrell 's previous band , before eventually adopting the name that Staley 's previous band had initially flirted with , Alice in Chains .

Gauthier was a controversial musician in her time . Her choice of music for performance was often condemned , and often praised . The appropriateness of jazz music for a classically trained singer , combined with the performances taking place in concert halls lead some critics to cheer her for promoting otherwise overlooked music , and others to condemn her for taking lowbrow music into a highbrow venue .
In the early 1940s , Service des Travaux Publics carried out random excavations . Father Fancheux and Raymand Surleau , who were not qualified archaeologists , carried out the excavations at Arikamedu and sent a few antiquities to Indian museums , and also to the cole fran aise d 'Extr me - Orient in Hanoi .
Chris Csullion of Official Nintendo Magazine said that if you 've played Broken Sword , the words ' the goat puzzle ' will probably make you break out in a cold sweat . Geoff Thew of Hardcore Gamer wrote that Broken Sword was known for intricate , challenging puzzles some infamously so . The puzzle appeared on Computer and Video Games ' 2011 feature , Gaming 's hardest puzzles . In 2012 , it was listed on GameFront 's 5 Crazy Difficult and Intricate Video Game Puzzles . During a classic postmortem for The Shadow of the Templars at the European Game Developers Conference in August 2014 , when Cecil brought up the topic of difficult puzzles , a member of the audience shouted That fucking goat ! ; laughter ensued , and Cecil added : It was very unfair , and it was absolutely bewildering . He also continued , claiming he knew he had made it when a taxi driver once questioned him about his occupation : upon finding out he had written Broken Sword the driver exclaimed , Ah , so you 're the one responsible for the goat puzzle ! 
In the same year appeared the Sonate de Concert , Op. 47 , for cello and piano , among the most difficult and ambitious in the romantic repertoire ... anticipating Mahler in its juxtaposition of the sublime and the trivial , and with its four movements showing again an anticipation of progressive tonality , each ascending by a major third . Other anticipations of Mahler who was born in 1860 can be found in the two military Op. 50 piano studies of 1859 Capriccio alla soldatesca and Le tambour bat aux champs The drum beats the retreat , as well as in certain of the miniatures of the 1861 Esquisses , Op. 63 . The bizarre and unclassifiable Marcia funebre , sulla morte d 'un Pappagallo Funeral march on the death of a parrot , 1859 , for three oboes , bassoon and voices , described by Kenneth Hamilton as Monty - Pythonesque , is also of this period .

Continuing southward , NY 93 runs across open , rolling terrain , meeting CR 259 Tonawanda Creek Road on its way to the hamlet of Swifts Mills . Here , the rural surroundings briefly give way to residential areas as NY 93 intersects with CR 255 Swift Mills Road in the center of the community . South of Swifts Mills , the road serves only intermittent stretches of homes for 2 miles 3 . 2 km , including a cluster of residences around its closely spaced intersections with CR 253 Carney Road and CR 42 Rapids Road . It continues on a southward track past the eastern terminus of CR 218 Hunts Corner Akron Road to the outskirts of the village of Akron , where the highway turns east onto Lewis Road and soon enters the village limits . NY 93 runs past a line of homes before intersecting Cedar Street , a road maintained by Erie County as CR 261 north of the village .
Anderson began working on the script for his next feature film during his troubles with Hard Eight , completing the script in 1995 . The result was Anderson 's breakout for the drama film Boogie Nights 1997 , which is based on his short The Dirk Diggler Story . The script was noticed by New Line Cinema 's president , Michael De Luca , who felt totally gaga reading it . It was released on October 10 , 1997 and was a critical and commercial success . The film revived the career of Burt Reynolds , and provided breakout roles for Mark Wahlberg and Julianne Moore . At the 70th Academy Awards ceremony , the film received three Academy Award nominations , including for Best Supporting Actor Burt Reynolds , Best Supporting Actress Julianne Moore and Best Original Screenplay .
The brigade 's Headquarters Company managed the engineer battalions but it also undertook its own missions , including humanitarian missions and public affairs assignments . It was supported by the brigade 's Special Troops Battalion which provided a wide range of duties for the Headquarters . The task of detecting and removing IEDs proved particularly difficult for the brigade , as IEDs were a serious issue for coalition forces and the leading cause of casualties at the time . The 54th Engineer Battalion under the 130th was specially tasked with counter - IED operations on the over 300 kilometers of roads that the brigade was responsible for . The 249th Engineer Battalion was charged with maintaining the power grid throughout Iraq . They were required to assess 200 power stations throughout the country and make repairs to each one individually . The 84th Engineer Battalion was tasked with most construction projects in the Forward Operating Bases . These projects involved expansion of many of the larger FOBs as smaller ones were shut down and consolidated . One of the main focuses of the Battalion was the expansion of living quarters at Al Asad Air Base . The 565th Engineer Battalion was responsible for maintaining the supply yards housing building materials for the rest of the Brigade 's battalions , and to ensure that the materials were dispersed and used as efficiently as possible . The brigade 's mechanical and vehicle maintenance duties were provided by civilian contractors . These contractors also handled transportation of construction vehicles and vehicle parts to the theater .
In the 1770s , the French naturalist Comte de Buffon stated that the dodo inhabited both Mauritius and R union . It is unclear why he included R union , but he also combined accounts about the Rodrigues solitaire and a third bird oiseau de Nazareth , now thought to be a dodo under the same section . English naturalist Hugh Edwin Strickland discussed the old descriptions of the R union solitaire in his 1848 book The Dodo and Its Kindred , and concluded it was distinct from the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire . Baron Edmond de S lys Longchamps coined the scientific name Apterornis solitarius for the R union solitaire in 1848 , apparently making it the type species of the genus , in which he also included two other Mascarene birds only known from contemporary accounts , the red rail and the R union swamphen . As the name Apterornis had already been used for a different bird by Richard Owen , and the other former names were likewise invalid , Bonaparte coined the new binomial Ornithaptera borbonica in 1854 Bourbon was the original French name for R union . In 1854 , Hermann Schlegel placed the solitaire in the same genus as the dodo , and named it Didus apterornis . He restored it strictly according to contemporary accounts , which resulted in an ibis or stork - like bird instead of a dodo . As it was considered congeneric with the dodo , the R union solitaire was long believed to also be a member of the Dididae family of pigeons .
After the British 5th Infantry Division had achieved its objectives , the 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade attacked at 04 : 00 on 24 December . Despite intensive artillery support 272 guns on a 3 , 500 yards 3 , 200 m front , the tired and understrength New Zealand battalions struggled to make progress . By the afternoon , it had become clear to the New Zealand commander Bernard Freyberg that the stubborn defences of the 26th Panzer Division would not be broached . He is reported to have remarked , It is not a question of further advance , it is a question of holding on to what we have got . The XIII Corps front was effectively deadlocked and settled into a posture of active defence and patrolling .

A month after Arbeideren went defunct , the Communist Party gave its name to a new newspaper , which was set up as the new main newspaper of the Communist Party in 1930 . This new paper was based in Oslo as the replacement of Norges Kommunistblad , which had been liquidated as well . Olav Larssen and Evald Solbakken found a new outlet in Hamar Arbeiderblad , which had been set up as the new Hamar organ of the Labour Party in 1925 . The Communist Party later tried to create a weekly newspaper in Hamar , R d Front , but it was short - lived and existed only between 1932 and 1933 . The Oslo version of Arbeideren went defunct in 1940 , and many years after that , the name was used from 1951 to 1953 for a third newspaper , published in Brumunddal , not far from Hamar city .
After the end of the war in April , Atlanta was decommissioned in Philadelphia on 21 June 1865 and placed in reserve at League Island . She was sold to Sam Ward on 4 May 1869 for the price of 25 , 000 and subsequently delivered to representatives of Haiti on 8 December by Sydney Oaksmith , a lawyer who had received an advance of 50 , 000 on her purchase price of 260 , 000 . The ship was briefly seized by the Customs Service , possibly for violations of neutrality laws as she had just loaded four large guns and a number of recruits for the forces of Sylvain Salnave , President of Haiti , who was embroiled in a civil war . Atlanta was released and sailed for Port - au - Prince three days later . She broke down in Delaware Bay and had to put in at Chester , Pennsylvania for repairs . The ship , now renamed either Triumph or Triumfo , departed on 18 December 1869 and vanished en route , apparently sinking with the loss of all hands , either off Cape Hatteras or the Delaware Capes .

Like all streams in Lycoming and Sullivan Counties , Plunketts Creek served as an area for settlers to establish homesteads , mills , and to a lesser extent , farms . Barbours , the first village on the creek , was founded in 1832 , when John S. Barbour , a Scottish immigrant , built a sawmill opposite the mouth of Plunketts Creek on Loyalsock Creek . Originally known as Barbour 's Mills , the village is in a rare area of flat land in the narrow Loyalsock valley and contains the mouths of both Plunketts and Bear Creeks . Barbours became a lumber center which owed its existence to those forested mountains and the creeks that flow out of them . John Scaife arrived in 1856 and became a prosperous lumberman and farmer . His family became prominent in Barbours , and in 1997 , his 86 - year - old granddaughter , Virdie Scaife Houser Landon , recalled that in her childhood every family that had 15 cents to their name had a sawmill for cutting lumber . By 1878 the village had several blacksmiths , a temperance hotel , its own post office , many sawmills , a school , and a wagon maker . Barbours flourished throughout the rest of the nineteenth century .
As early as 1857 the Beetons had considered using the magazine columns as the basis of a book of collected recipes and homecare advice , Hughes believes , and in November 1859 they launched a series of 48 - page monthly supplements with The Englishwoman 's Domestic Magazine . The print block for the whole series of the supplements was set from the beginning so the break between each edition was fixed at 48 pages , regardless of the text , and in several issues the text of a sentence or recipe is split between the end of one instalment and the beginning of the next .
The Counterfeit story features the character Lisa undergoing plastic surgery to become Tessa 's double . Lisa was played by Meilani Paul before the surgery and by Vandernoot after it . The producers wondered whether the story needed to explain the change in Lisa 's voice , as she would be played by a different actor . They considered suggesting that her voice changed because of the surgery , then decided that Lisa would have voice training . After her operation , Lisa speaks with Vandernoot 's voice when posing as Tessa , and with Meilani Paul 's voice when the character was not acting . This was achieved using automated dialogue replacement during post - production .
Airports generally have long , fully lit , hard - surfaced runways , full air traffic control , and navigation and landing aids . They are usually located on urban fringes , support commercial and business operations , and often exclude certain types of light aircraft . At the more rurally located airfields , the lighter end of aviation , such as microlight and gliding activities , becomes increasingly prevalent , and there are few or no commercial operations other than flying schools . At this level runways are generally shorter , and grass surfaces are increasingly common . Navigation aids are increasingly scarce , being more basic where they are available , and informal ground to air radio communication replaces air traffic control . The smallest airfields are too small to feature on general purpose Ordnance Survey OS maps , and lack basic facilities such as fuel and maintenance . The majority of airstrips are basically single short grass runways with no supporting facilities , although the presence of a hangar is not uncommon at the larger examples . They do not feature on OS maps , and are owned by private clubs or , more commonly , individuals .
Coached by Mike Ruddock , Wales won their first Grand Slam since 1978 and their first ever Six Nations Grand Slam in 2005 . A late long range penalty from Gavin Henson gave them a victory over England at Cardiff for the first time in 12 years , and after victories over Italy , France , Scotland , they faced Ireland in front of a capacity crowd at the Millennium Stadium where Wales ' 32 20 victory gave them their first Championship since 1994 . Later that year they suffered a record home loss , 41 3 to New Zealand .
In 1999 , Fowler was fined 60 , 000 by his club for bringing the game into disrepute . While celebrating his goal against Liverpool 's Merseyside rivals , Everton , Fowler used the white line of the penalty area to simulate cocaine use . Liverpool manager G rard Houllier stated that this was a Cameroonian grass - eating celebration , learnt from teammate Rigobert Song . Defending himself , Fowler later said this was a response to Everton fans who had insulted him with false accusations of drug abuse . Fowler received a four - match suspension from the FA for this incident . At the same FA disciplinary hearing , Fowler received a further two match suspension due to a separate incident in which he had taunted the Chelsea defender Graeme Le Saux by waving his backside at him as Le Saux 's wife and children watched from the stands . Fowler later attempted to justify his actions by suggesting his taunts were simply an extension of gamesmanship . The FA imposed a 32 , 000 fine and a six - match ban for the two incidents . Fowler has since apologized to Le Saux for the incident .
The table on the right lists the ten longest tributaries of the Missouri , along with their respective catchment areas and flows . Length is measured to the hydrologic source , regardless of naming convention . The main stem of the Kansas River , for example , is 148 miles 238 km long . However , including the longest headwaters tributaries , the 453 - mile 729 km Republican River and the 156 - mile 251 km Arikaree River , brings the total length to 749 miles 1 , 205 km . Similar naming issues are encountered with the Platte River , whose longest tributary , the North Platte River , is more than twice as long as its mainstream .

Gold , commonly known as Gold Beach , was the code name for one of the five areas of the Allied invasion of German - occupied France in the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944 , during the Second World War . Gold , the central of the five areas , was located between Port - en - Bessin on the west and La Rivi re on the east . High cliffs at the western end of the zone meant that the landings took place on the flat section between Le Hamel and La Rivi re , in the sectors code - named Jig and King . Taking Gold was to be the responsibility of the British Army , with sea transport , mine sweeping , and a naval bombardment force provided by the Royal Navy as well as elements from the Dutch , Polish and other Allied navies .
The entry and exit of large molecules from the nucleus is tightly controlled by the nuclear pore complexes . Although small molecules can enter the nucleus without regulation , macromolecules such as RNA and proteins require association karyopherins called importins to enter the nucleus and exportins to exit . Cargo proteins that must be translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus contain short amino acid sequences known as nuclear localization signals , which are bound by importins , while those transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm carry nuclear export signals bound by exportins . The ability of importins and exportins to transport their cargo is regulated by GTPases , enzymes that hydrolyze the molecule guanosine triphosphate to release energy . The key GTPase in nuclear transport is Ran , which can bind either GTP or GDP guanosine diphosphate , depending on whether it is located in the nucleus or the cytoplasm . Whereas importins depend on RanGTP to dissociate from their cargo , exportins require RanGTP in order to bind to their cargo .
Antimony has two stable isotopes : 121Sb with a natural abundance of 57 . 36 and 123Sb with a natural abundance of 42 . 64 . It also has 35 radioisotopes , of which the longest - lived is 125Sb with a half - life of 2 . 75 years . In addition , 29 metastable states have been characterized . The most stable of these is 120m1Sb with a half - life of 5 . 76 days . Isotopes that are lighter than the stable 123Sb tend to decay by decay , and those that are heavier tend to decay by decay , with some exceptions .

While Wi niowiecki 's portrayal as a major secondary character in the first part of Henryk Sienkiewicz 's trilogy , With Fire and Sword which describes the history of the Polish - Lithuanian Commonwealth during the Uprising , was rather positive , criticism of his persona intensified , in particular from Sienkiewicz detractors such as Zygmunt Kaczkowski and Olgierd G rka . The 1930s saw a first modern historical work about Wi niowiecki , by W adys aw Tomkiewicz . In the era of the People 's Republic of Poland , the Communist Party 's ideology dictated that all historians present him as an enemy of the people , although this began to be relaxed after 1965 . Widacki , analyzing the work of other historians notes that W adys aw Czapli ski was rather sympathetic to Wi niowiecki , while Pawe Jasienica was critical of him .

The next most important record type are those achieved at a specific competition . For example , the Olympic records represent the best performances by athletes at the Summer Olympics . All major championships and games have their relevant competition records and a large number of track and field meetings keep a note of their meet records . Other record types include : stadium records , records by age range , records by disability , and records by institution or organisation . Cash bonuses are usually offered to athletes if they break significant records , as doing so can generate greater interest and public attendance in track and field competitions .
Abolition of the royal prerogative is not on the immediate horizon , and recent movements to abolish the role of the monarchy and its royal prerogative in government have been unsuccessful . The Ministry of Justice undertook a review of executive Royal Prerogative powers in October 2009 . Former Labour MP and cabinet minister Tony Benn campaigned unsuccessfully for the abolition of the royal prerogative in the United Kingdom in the 1990s , arguing that all governmental powers in effect exercised on the advice of the prime minister and cabinet should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and require parliamentary approval . Later governments argued that such is the breadth of topics covered by the royal prerogative that requiring parliamentary approval in each instance where the prerogative is currently used would overwhelm parliamentary time and slow the enactment of legislation .

The effect of Busch 's illustrations are enhanced by his forthright verse , with taunts , derision , ironic twists , exaggeration , ambiguity and startling rhymes . His language had an influence on the humorous poetry of Erich K stner , Kurt Tucholsky , Joachim Ringelnatz and Christian Morgenstern . The contrast in his later work between comic illustration and its seemingly serious accompanying text already demonstrated in his earlier Max and Moritz is shown in Widow Bolte 's mawkish dignity which is disproportionate to the loss of her chickens :
According to Casting Crowns ' lead singer Mark Hall , the idea for Who Am I came while he was driving home with his wife and children one night . Hall , who was having personal worship time during the drive , recounts that he wondered Who am I to think I can just call up to God whenever I want , from the middle of nowhere , and expect Him to hear me ? Hall says immediately I started thinking I 'm a new creation , I 'm more than a conqueror ... I 'm also grass , that is rises up and is gone in a day . In an interview , he commented that me being a conqueror is true , but at the same time I need to understand that my life is a vapor , and me being able to even pray to God is because of what he 's done for me . Who Am I was produced by Mark A. Miller and Steven Curtis Chapman . It was recorded at Glow In The Dark Studio in Decatur , Georgia and Zoo Studio in Franklin , Tennessee , and it was engineered by Matt Goldman and Sam Hewitt .
In 1997 , Alan Ball resolved to move into the film industry after several frustrating years writing for the television sitcoms Grace Under Fire and Cybill . He joined the United Talent Agency , where his representative , Andrew Cannava , suggested he write a spec script to reintroduce himself to the town as a screenwriter . Ball pitched three ideas to Cannava : two conventional romantic comedies and American Beauty , which he had originally conceived as a play in the early 1990s . Despite the story 's lack of an easily marketable concept , Cannava selected American Beauty because he felt it was the one for which Ball had the most passion . While developing the script , Ball created another television sitcom , Oh , Grow Up . He channeled his anger and frustration at having to accede to network demands on that show and during his tenures on Grace Under Fire and Cybill into writing American Beauty .
While the advantages of latex have made it the most popular condom material , it does have some drawbacks . Latex condoms are damaged when used with oil - based substances as lubricants , such as petroleum jelly , cooking oil , baby oil , mineral oil , skin lotions , suntan lotions , cold creams , butter or margarine . Contact with oil makes latex condoms more likely to break or slip off due to loss of elasticity caused by the oils . Additionally , latex allergy precludes use of latex condoms and is one of the principal reasons for the use of other materials . In May 2009 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted approval for the production of condoms composed of Vytex , latex that has been treated to remove 90 of the proteins responsible for allergic reactions . An allergen - free condom made of synthetic latex polyisoprene is also available .

The first dent in this stability came about in 1607 , with the Case of Prohibitions . James VI and I claimed that as monarch , he had a divine right to sit as a judge and interpret the common law as he saw fit . Led by Sir Edward Coke , the judiciary rejected this idea , stating that while the monarch was not subject to any individual , he was subject to the law . Until he had gained sufficient knowledge of the law , he had no right to interpret it ; Coke pointed out that such knowledge demanded mastery of an artificial reason ... which requires long study and experience , before that a man can attain to the cognizance of it . Similarly , in the Case of Proclamations in 1611 , Coke held that the monarch could only exercise those prerogatives he already had , and not create new ones .

Much of the Plunketts Creek valley and those of its tributaries is composed of various glacial deposits . Closer to the mouth , there are large deposits of alluvium , as well as alluvial fan and alluvial terraces . Many of the glacial deposits are associated with the Wisconsin glaciation , with stratified drift and till , as well as outwash present . The alluvium is 10 feet 3 m or more thick in the lower reaches of the Plunketts Creek valley , but only 6 feet 2 m thick in headward tributary valleys . The outwash is described as stratified sand and gravel that form terrace remnants along the flanks of Loyalsock Creek and Plunketts Creek valleys .

In July 2010 , CNN returned to Port - au - Prince and reported , It looks like the quake just happened yesterday , and Imogen Wall , spokeswoman for the United Nations office of humanitarian affairs in Haiti , said that six months from that time it may still look the same . Land ownership posed a particular problem for rebuilding because so many pre - quake homes were not officially registered . Even before the national registry fell under the rubble , land tenure was always a complex and contentious issue in Haiti . Many areas of Port - au - Prince were settled either by tonton makout Duvalier 's death squads given land for their service or by squatters . In many cases land ownership was never officially registered . Even if this logistical logjam were to be cleared , the vast majority of Port - au - Prince residents , up to 85 percent , did not own their homes before the earthquake .

The population of Ireland collapsed dramatically during the second half of the 19th century . A population of over 8 million in 1841 was reduced to slightly more than 4 million by 1921 . In part , the fall in population was due to death from the Great Famine of 1845 to 1852 , which took about 1 million lives . However , by far the greater cause of population decline was the dire economic state of the country which led to an entrenched culture of emigration lasting until the 21st century .
The Old Testament refers to ten individual commandments , even though there are more than ten imperative sentences in the two relevant texts : Exodus 20 : 1 17 and Deuteronomy 5 : 6 21 . The Old Testament does not make clear how the texts should be divided to arrive at ten commandments . The division traditionally used by the Catholic and Lutheran churches was first derived by the Latin Church Father Augustine of Hippo 354 430 in his book Questions on Exodus . Other Christian churches , such as the Eastern Orthodox and some Protestant churches , use a form established by the Greek Fathers . The two forms have slightly different numbering , but maintain exactly the same substance despite Protestant accusations to the contrary . Jewish numbering differs from Christian denominations in that it considers what many Christians call a prologue to be the entire first commandment .
The pamphlet was read by Augustin Robespierre , brother of Maximilien Robespierre , who was impressed by the revolutionary context . The pamphlet itself had little effect against the rebellious forces , but served to advance Napoleon 's career . He soon became recognised for his political ambitions by a Corsica - born politician , and family friend , Christophe Saliceti , who arranged to have it published and distributed . Christophe 's influence , along with fellow Convention deputy Augustin Robespierre , advanced Napoleon into the position of senior gunner , at Toulon .

The ride was announced on January 5 , 1996 as Superman : The Escape , breaking records as the first roller coaster to reach 100 miles per hour 160 km h , passing Desperado and Phantom 's Revenge at 82 miles per hour 132 km h . The ride was designed by Intamin , a Swiss roller coaster firm . It was originally intended to open on June 1 , 1996 . However , due to a range of problems with the launch system , its opening was delayed . In late 1996 , there was a preview for season pass holders . After 10 months of testing and reengineering , the ride opened on March 15 , 1997 . After its opening , the media claimed Superman to be the fastest roller coaster in the world . However , since it was delayed , a similar roller coaster known as Tower of Terror , which also has a 100 - mile - per - hour launch 160 km h , had opened about a month earlier at Dreamworld in Australia . Superman therefore lost its claim as being the first roller coaster to reach 100 miles per hour 160 km h , although it was then tied with Tower of Terror as the fastest roller coaster in the world . However , the ride became the first roller coaster in the world to go over 400 ft , therefore becoming the tallest roller coaster in the world at the time .

He is also a member of board of directors of Forum 2000 .
General Clinton encountered the first major problem of the attack plan on June 17 . An attempt to wade the channel between the two islands established that part of the channel was at least shoulder - deep , too deep for troops to cross even without the prospect of enemy opposition . He considered using boats to ferry the troops across , but the Americans , with timely advice from General Lee , adopted a strong defensive position that was virtually impossible to bombard from ships or the Long Island position . As a result , the British and American forces faced each other across the channel , engaging in occasional and largely inconsequential cannon fire at long range . Clinton reported that this meant that Admiral Parker would have the glory of being defeated alone . The attack was originally planned for June 24 , but bad weather and contrary wind conditions prompted Parker to call it off for several days .
As Tropical Storm Jose formed so close to shore there was a lead time of less than 9 hours on the tropical storm warning for the Veracruz coastline . The area covered by the warning issued on August 22 was extended southwards as Jose intensified , before being canceled soon after landfall on August 23 . The advisories issued by the National Hurricane Center emphasized that rainfall from Jose was the primary threat .

Jane Guildford was born in Kent in about 1508 1509 , the only daughter of Sir Edward Guildford and Eleanor West , daughter of Thomas West , 8th Baron De La Warr . Her schooling occurred at home together with her brother Richard and her future husband , who was her father 's ward from 1512 . In 1525 , at about 16 , she married Sir John Dudley , who was 20 or 21 years old . The match had been arranged by their parents some years before . Jane Dudley gave birth to 13 children , eight boys and five girls . In most cases it is impossible to establish their birthdates exactly . An exception is Robert , the future favourite of Elizabeth I ; he was born in 1532 as the fifth son , and possibly after the eldest daughter Mary , who became the mother of the courtier - poet Philip Sidney . The family life of John and Jane Dudley seems to have been happy and was free from any scandals ; around 1535 a poem praised the love and devotion of their marriage .

For the average soldier , life at the fort was monotonous . Until the permanent structures were built , soldiers had to live in tents , which lacked comfort . Aside from a few whiskey peddlers and prostitutes , few civilians lived at the fort . Officers had brought their personal slaves with them , including Captain Swords . Five miles East in Missouri was a grog shop that supplied soldiers , and quite a few courts - martial followed soldiers ' going AWOL at the shop . The desertion rate from the fort ranged from 12 -16 , due to boredom , irregular pay , and hatred for military life . As no combat took place near the fort , it seemed more of a frontier village than a military base . Hunting was a popular pastime ; according to Captain Swords , wolf chasing and duck hunting was the only way one officer could tolerate the place .
Although Du Fu 's frequent references to his own difficulties can give the impression of an all - consuming solipsism , Hawkes argues that his famous compassion in fact includes himself , viewed quite objectively and almost as an afterthought . He therefore lends grandeur to the wider picture by comparing it to his own slightly comical triviality .

A year into Park 's life sentence , around 40 family members and friends held a vigil at Strangeways Prison , in a bid to raise awareness of the fact that there is an innocent man in prison . Another was held a year later , led by Jenny Park , and a third on the third anniversary of Park 's imprisonment . It was due to these vigils , claimed Evangelical Pastor George Harrison , that he was barred from visiting Park once he was transferred to Garth prison , in Lancashire . Other fronts for the campaign included an offer of 5 , 000 for anyone providing evidence that lead to Gordon 's freedom . Included in this were planned adverts in the North - West Evening Mail and leaflets to 20 , 000 homes in the Furness area . However , this was being organised by Harrison , with whom Gordon and his third wife Jennifer stayed during the trial . Jeremy Park wrote to the North - West Evening Mail to confirm that he wanted nothing to do with the reward , and that Harrison had no right to include his name , contact details or email address , or mention the freegordon website , in the adverts . Subsequently , Harrison claimed to have delivered 6 , 000 booklets and leaflets in the Furness area .
Due to increased demand and greater social acceptance , condoms began to be sold in a wider variety of retail outlets , including in supermarkets and in discount department stores such as Wal - Mart . Condom sales increased every year until 1994 , when media attention to the AIDS pandemic began to decline . The phenomenon of decreasing use of condoms as disease preventatives has been called prevention fatigue or condom fatigue . Observers have cited condom fatigue in both Europe and North America . As one response , manufacturers have changed the tone of their advertisements from scary to humorous .

There are two temples named Durga in Varanasi : Durga Mandir built in the 16th century exact date not known , and Durga Kund Sanskrit ' kund ' meaning pond or pool built in the 18th century . A large number of Hindu devotees visit Durga Kund during Navratri to worship the goddess Durga . The temple , built in the Nagara architectural style , has multi - tiered spires and is stained red with ochre , representing the red colour of Durga . The building has a rectangular tank of water called the Durga Kund Kund meaning a pond or pool . During annual celebrations of Nag Panchami , the act of depicting the god Vishnu reclining on the serpent Shesha is recreated in the Kund . While the Annapurna Temple , located nearby to the Kashi Vishwanath Temple , is dedicated to Annapurna , the goddess of food , the Sankatha Temple adjacent to the Sindhia Ghat is dedicated to Sankatha , the goddess of remedy . The Sankatha Temple has a large sculpture of a lion and a cluster of nine smaller temples dedicated to the nine planets . Other temples of note are : the Bharat Mata Temple , dedicated to the national personification of India , which was inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi in 1936 , the Kalabhairav Temple , the Mrithyunjay Mahadev Temple , and the New Vishwanath Temple located in the campus of BHU , the Tulsi Manas Mandir .
QuackShot was released to mostly positive reviews from video game journalists . The game was universally lauded for its graphics , with magazines like Sega Pro describing them as some of the best graphics around . The game was also praised for its music and puzzles , as well as their clever use in the game . However , QuackShot was criticized for its controls , being described by IGN as float - y and making certain segments of the game unnecessarily difficult . The game was also criticized for its lack of difficulty overall as well as its lack of speech samples , which several other Genesis games of the time had .
Experts disagree over whether temnospondyls were ancestral to modern amphibians frogs , salamanders , and caecilians , or whether the whole group died out without leaving any descendants . Different hypotheses have placed modern amphibians as the descendants of temnospondyls , another group of early tetrapods called lepospondyls , or even as descendants of both groups with caecilians evolving from lepospondyls and frogs and salamanders evolving from temnospondyls . Recent studies place a family of temnospondyls called the amphibamids as the closest relatives of modern amphibians . Similarities in teeth , skulls , and hearing structures link the two groups .
Trinsey v. Pennsylvania 941 F.2d 224 was a case decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit that confirmed the validity of special elections held without a primary under the Fourteenth and Seventeenth Amendments to the United States Constitution . The case came about due to the death of H. John Heinz III , one of the US Senators from Pennsylvania , in a plane crash on April 4 , 1991 . Under the Seventeenth Amendment , state legislatures may give the Governor the power to appoint officials to fill temporarily vacant Senate seats until a special election can be held , and Pennsylvanian law contained a statute executing this and requiring no primaries for the special election . Instead , both the Democrats and Republicans would each internally select their candidates . John S. Trinsey Jr . , a voter and potential candidate , asked the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to declare the statute unconstitutional as a violation on the Fourteenth and Seventeenth amendments , because the lack of a primary removed his right to properly vote for candidates and delegated that power to political parties .
The Republic of Ireland has shown a strong commitment to renewable energy , ranking as one of the top 10 markets for cleantech investment in the 2014 Global Green Economy Index . Research and development in Ireland in renewable energy such as wind power has increased since 2004 . Large wind farms are being constructed in coastal counties such as Cork , Donegal , Mayo and Antrim . The construction of wind farms has in some cases been delayed by opposition from local communities , some of whom overall consider the wind turbines to be unsightly . The Republic of Ireland is also hindered by an ageing network that was not designed to handle the varying availability of power that comes from wind farms . The ESB 's Turlough Hill facility is the only power - storage facility in the state .
The novel has also been adapted for the stage , by Jorge Al Triana and his daughter Veronica Triana , directed by Jorge Triana : the play was put on in Spanish , but with simultaneous translation to English at Repertorio Espa ol www.repertorio.org chivo in New York in 2003 ; and the production moved to Lima in 2007 . A feature of the novel 's stage version is that the same actor plays both Agustin Cabral and Rafael Trujillo . For reviewer Bruce Weber , this makes the point that Trujillo 's control of the nation depended on gutless collaborators .
Oldham 's topography is characterised by its rugged , elevated Pennine terrain . It has an area of 6 . 91 square miles 17 . 90 km2 . The geology of Oldham is represented by the Millstone Grit and Coal Measures series of rocks . The River Beal , flowing northwards , forms the boundary between Oldham on one side and Royton and Shaw and Crompton on the other .
Typhoon Lupit formed on November 18 from the monsoon trough to the west of the Marshall Islands . Early in its duration , it moved generally to the west or west - southwest . On November 21 , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Lupit , and two days later , it strengthened into a typhoon , developing an eye . Lupit later began a prolonged movement to the northwest , during which it passed near several islands in Yap State . The typhoon reached peak intensity on November 26 , with peak 10 minute sustained winds of 185 km h 115 mph . It later weakened due to a variety of unfavorable conditions , and after recurving to the northeast , Lupit became extratropical south of Japan on December 2 .
After the completion of shooting at the arena set in Ramoji Film City , the arena set was demolished and a set for heroine 's house was constructed in its place . This was the last set constructed for this film . By late September 2008 , 70 of the film 's shoot was complete . The remix version of Bangaru Kodipetta was shot by Ram Charan and Mumaith Khan under the supervision of Prem Rakshith at Chennai Port , although Visakhapatnam Port was first considered . Filming continued in and around Hyderabad very discreetly in November 2008 . Stunt sequences by Ram Charan and some stuntmen were shot in mid - December 2008 at Hyderabad . By mid February 2009 , the film 's scripted part had been wrapped up , with only some songs left to shoot . The song Nakosam Nuvvu was shot in Switzerland while Panchadara Bomma Bomma was shot at Golkonda Fort in Hyderabad . Both songs were duets shot by Ram Charan and Kajal . K. K. Senthil Kumar said in an interview that Magadheera could not have been made in eight months because of its long pre - production and post - production phases . Over two lakhs worth of props , including swords , daggers , knives , bows and arrows , pouches , armour , footwear and other accessories , were used in the film . They were designed by 160 workers , including welders , molders , carpenters , painters , cobblers , artists , tailors and leather men , who worked for two months in the Geetha Arts Studio . Five people were appointed exclusively to look after these props . However , during the film 's shoot both Peter Hein and Ram Charan suffered major injuries . The former fell down from a height of 80 90 feet during the composition of a stunt and was advised a bed rest for four months . Charan faced severe leg fractures , while Rajamouli said that Peter met with an accident on the sets , had two broken ribs , fractured hands and jaw and lost all his teeth . Within a month , he was back on the sets with his face and body covered in bandages and plaster . He could barely lift his hands to shoot . 
In 1987 South Glamorgan County Council had intended to build a viaduct cross the River Taff and then go onto an elevated section through Butetown on stilts . But the newly formed Cardiff Bay Development Corporation along with local residents objected to the scheme that they said would cut through Butetown and split the community , creating an unnecessary physical barrier between the two areas to the north and south of the link road . By 1988 South Glamorgan County Council had agreed to change the design of the link road , despite having already spent 6 years of design work on the link road meant that a tunnel had to be built instead . The cost of the Butetown Link Road was estimated to cost 35 million , but this had risen to 45M in 1988 , before the design change .
The history of Islais Creek dates to the 18th century . The name Los Islais first appeared on Mexican maps in 1834 , named for the Islay cherries that grew wildly in the area . By 1850 , water from the creek was used by farmers to irrigate crops . The Gold Rush marked the decline of the creek as large numbers of gold rushers swarmed into the city .
Two of the many references to this parable are found in Tattvarthaslokavatika of Vidyanandi 9th century and Sy dv damanjari of c rya Mallisena 13th century . Mallisena uses the parable to argue that immature people deny various aspects of truth ; deluded by the aspects they do understand , they deny the aspects they don 't understand . Due to extreme delusion produced on account of a partial viewpoint , the immature deny one aspect and try to establish another . This is the maxim of the blind men and the elephant . Mallisena also cites the parable when noting the importance of considering all viewpoints in obtaining a full picture of reality . It is impossible to properly understand an entity consisting of infinite properties without the method of modal description consisting of all viewpoints , since it will otherwise lead to a situation of seizing mere sprouts i.e. , a superficial , inadequate cognition , on the maxim of the blind men and the elephant . 
Running through late 1975 and again through early 1976 , the tour encompassed the release of the album Desire , with many of Dylan 's new songs featuring a travelogue - like narrative style , showing the influence of his new collaborator , playwright Jacques Levy . The 1976 half of the tour was documented by a TV concert special , Hard Rain , and the LP Hard Rain ; no concert album from the better - received and better - known opening half of the tour was released until 2002 's Live 1975 .

 Early life and modeling career 
The earliest known written version of the Laws of Cricket , dating from 1744 , does not include an lbw rule . At the time , batsmen in English cricket used curved bats , which made it unlikely that they would be able to stand directly in front of the wickets . However , a clause in the 1744 laws gave umpires the power to take action if the batsman was standing unfair to strike . Cricket bats were modified to become straighter over the following years , allowing batsmen to stand closer to the wickets . Subsequently , some players deliberately began to obstruct the ball from hitting the wickets . Such tactics were criticised by writers and a revision of the laws in 1774 ruled that the batsman was out if he deliberately stopped the ball from hitting the wicket with his leg . However , critics noted that the umpires were left the difficult task of interpreting the intentions of batsmen . The 1788 version of the laws no longer required the umpires to take account of the batsman 's intent ; now a batsman was lbw if he stopped a ball that pitch ed straight . Further clarification of the law came in 1823 , when a condition was added that the ball must be delivered in a straight line to the wicket . The ambiguity of the wording was highlighted when two prominent umpires disagreed over whether the ball had to travel in a straight line from the bowler to the wicket , or between the wickets at either end of the pitch . In 1839 the MCC , by then responsible for drafting the Laws of Cricket , endorsed the latter interpretation and ruled the batsman out lbw if the ball pitched in between the wickets and would have hit the stumps .
Captain W. C. Pakenham , the Royal Navy 's official military observer under the Anglo - Japanese Alliance , took notes of the battle 's progress from a deck chair on Asahi 's exposed quarterdeck . His report confirmed the superiority of Japanese training and tactics and publicized the victory in the West .
An extraordinary climatic shock known as the Great Frost struck Ireland and the rest of Europe between December 1739 and September 1741 , after a decade of relatively mild winters . The winters destroyed stored crops of potatoes and other staples and the poor summers severely damaged harvests . This resulted in the famine of 1740 . An estimated 250 , 000 people about one in eight of the population died from the ensuing pestilence and disease . The Irish government halted export of corn and kept the army in quarters but did little more . Local gentry and charitable organisations provided relief but could do little to prevent the ensuing mortality .
 Late career and death 
A Somali officer who had a previous relationship with the embassy , Major Siad , agreed to travel to rescue the German charg d 'affaires and British ambassador junior staff from the British embassy had previously come to the US embassy . The Soviet Union was unable to land a plane in Mogadishu the previous day and the Soviet ambassador asked Ambassador Bishop if he and his staff could be rescued ; Ambassador Bishop , a tennis partner of his Soviet counterpart , agreed but only if they found their own way to the embassy . Seeing the helicopters on the morning of 5 January , they realized the Americans would not remain in the city much longer . At the request of Ambassador Bishop , Major Siad agreed to transport the Soviets , but only if he was paid enough ; the US embassy paid Major Siad , who returned with the Soviet ambassador and 38 of his staff . The brother of President Barre , who was also a Major General and Chief of Police , showed up at the embassy in the afternoon with 25 members of his family requesting to be evacuated , but was turned away after a vocal conversation with the ambassador .

Polish literature faced a similar fate in territories annexed by Germany , where the sale of Polish books was forbidden . The public destruction of Polish books was not limited to those seized from libraries , but also included those books that were confiscated from private homes . The last Polish book titles not already proscribed were withdrawn in 1943 ; even Polish prayer books were confiscated . Soon after the occupation began , most libraries were closed ; in Krak w , about 80 of the libraries were closed immediately , while the remainder saw their collections decimated by censors . The occupying powers destroyed Polish book collections , including the Sejm and Senate Library , the Przedziecki Estate Library , the Zamoyski Estate Library , the Central Military Library , and the Rapperswil Collection . In 1941 , the last remaining Polish public library in the German - occupied territories was closed in Warsaw . During the war , Warsaw libraries lost about a million volumes , or 30 of their collections . More than 80 of these losses were the direct result of purges rather than wartime conflict . Overall , it is estimated that about 10 million volumes from state - owned libraries and institutions perished during the war .
With the outbreak of the Hundred Years ' War in 1337 , Grosmont 's attention was turned towards France . He took part in several diplomatic missions and minor campaigns and was present at the great English victory in the naval Battle of Sluys in 1340 . Later the same year , he was required to commit himself as hostage in the Low Countries for the king 's considerable debts . He remained hostage until the next year and had to pay a large ransom for his own release . On his return he was made the king 's lieutenant in the north and stayed at Roxburgh until 1342 . The next years he spent in diplomatic negotiations in the Low Countries , Castile and Avignon .
Eventually , she declined the invitation to run for vice - president , saying that her only ambition was that in the large chapter of history that would be written about her husband the footnotes would mention a woman who brought the ... hopes and dreams of the people to the president , a woman who eventually turned those hopes and dreams into glorious reality . In Peronist rhetoric , this event has come to be referred to as The Renunciation , portraying Evita as having been a selfless woman in line with the Hispanic myth of marianismo . Most biographers , however , postulate that Evita did not so much renounce her ambition , as bow to pressure from her husband , the military , and the Argentine upper class , who preferred that she not enter the race .
In 1928 , M - 111 was assigned to a route connecting M - 13 later signed as US 23 for a time north of Bay City to Bay City State Park on Saginaw Bay . The original route consisted of what is today Euclid Avenue . In the early 1930s , a return leg towards Bay City was added to the east of the original route along what is now State Park Road , giving the route an upside - down - U shape.In 1933 , the western leg along Euclid Avenue from Midland Road to Beaver Road was designated as M - 47 . In 1938 , all of M - 111 was re - designated as M - 47 thus making M - 47 double back to Bay City .

Context is one other element to framing that is essential . The participants will be bound by norms of good manners : through frequency and length of turns at talk , through topics avoided , through circumspection in regard to references about self , through attention offered eagerly or begrudgingly - through all these means , rank and social relationship will be given their due . Certain things can and will be said in one scenario that would never be uttered in another . An awareness of these social framings is critical , just as is an awareness of the audience . Depending on who you re speaking with a teacher , a child , a loved one , a friend , a pet , etc . you will curve your speech to fit the frame of what your intended audience is expecting .

After ownership of the Meridian Main Street was transferred to the Alliance for Downtown Meridian in late 2007 , the two organizations , along with the Meridian Downtown Association , spearheaded the downtown revitalization effort . The Alliance serves as an umbrella organization , allowing the other two organizations to use the its support staff and housing , and in turn the Alliance serves as a liaison between the organizations . Plans were underway to renovate the Threefoot Building , but newly elected Mayor Cheri Barry killed the plans in early 2010 . Today , the Alliance helps to promote further development and restoration downtown ; its goal is to assist businesses such as specialty shops , restaurants , and bars because these help downtown become more active during the day and at night . The Meridian Downtown Association is primarily focused on increasing foot traffic downtown by organizing special events , and the Meridian Main Street program supports existing businesses downtown .
The Meridian Council for the Arts MCA was founded as Meridian 's and Lauderdale County 's official arts agency in 1978 . MCA operates its Community Art Grants program , the annual Threefoot Festival , several workshops , and other special events each year . MCA is partnered with many arts organizations in the city and county including the Meridian Museum of Art , the Meridian Little Theatre , and the Meridian Symphony Orchestra . Meridian Little Theatre , one of the South 's oldest subscription - based community theatres , was built in 1932 and currently provides entertainment to residents of and visitors to Meridian and Lauderdale County , entertaining over 22 , 000 guests each season , making it Mississippi 's most - attended community theatre . The Meridian Symphony Orchestra MSO founded in 1961 played its first concert in 1962 and its first full season in 1963 . In 1965 the MSO booked its first international soloist , Elena Nikolaidi , to perform with the orchestra . The Orchestra helped the Meridian Public School District develop its own orchestra and strings programs and also helped develop the Meridian Symphony Chorus . The current conductor is Dr. Claire Fox Hillard , who has been with the orchestra since 1991 . The MSO will celebrate its 50th anniversary in February 2011 with a performance from Itzhak Perlman .
Wales play in red jerseys , white shorts and red socks . For the 2015 16 season , the design of the Jersey incorporated gold for the first time . The jerseys are embroidered with the Prince of Wales 's feathers , which were chosen in the 19th century by the WRU over another Welsh symbol , the leek , to demonstrate the nation 's loyalty to Britain . In 1991 , to enable the device to be trademarked , the original generic motif was replaced with a more stylised version . The original motto beneath the feathers was Ich dien German for I serve but was replaced with WRU in the new version .
The first indication that the situation had changed significantly was on 23 June , when a group of 200 Usta e clashed with a group of rebels they estimated to number between 600 and 1 , 000 . After an extended firefight near the village of Stepen , 5 km 3 . 1 mi north of Korita , during which they suffered several casualties , the Usta e also burned down four villages . They then entered two Muslim - majority villages in the area and arrested 13 Serbs who had not been involved in the earlier fighting . The arrested Serbs were transported north to Avtovac and shot . That night , all adult Serbs above the age of 16 in Gacko , 4 . 5 km 2 . 8 mi northwest of Avtovac , were arrested , and 26 were immediately shot . The rest were transported 50 km 31 mi west to a camp in Nevesinje . Over the period 23 25 June , 150 Serbs from the village of Ravno , 30 km 19 mi southwest of Ljubinje , were arrested and killed at the gendarmerie post , and the remainder of the population fled to the hills .

In addition to hydrostatic equilibrium , the interior of a stable star will also maintain an energy balance of thermal equilibrium . There is a radial temperature gradient throughout the interior that results in a flux of energy flowing toward the exterior . The outgoing flux of energy leaving any layer within the star will exactly match the incoming flux from below .
Other work undertaken by the apprentices involved repairing some frost damage to the foundation brickwork , digging a drainage trench around the mill and moving the auxiliary engine into position . A concrete path around the tower was trapping moisture , leading to rising damp . A French drain was constructed around the mill to remedy these problem . A 21 horsepower 16 kW Ruston Hornsby 4YHR diesel engine had been purchased in 1981 and was fitted onto a permanent concrete base with the aid of a mobile crane . After fitting it was then painted . Some missing or broken parts were made or repaired as necessary .
On February 26 , 2010 , Butler traveled to Valparaiso for their regular season finale . Leading scorer Gordon Hayward was sidelined with lower back pain , but the team still won 74 69 . In so doing , Stevens broke the coaching record he had tied the prior week and Butler completed an 18 0 undefeated conference schedule . It was Butler 's first undefeated conference record since joining the Horizon League , and first since Joe Sexson led the 1978 team to a 6 0 record in the now defunct Indiana Collegiate Conference . Stevens earned his third straight regular - season conference championship .
The weather was unremarkable for two years . In 1928 , construction was completed on the Tamiami Trail , named because it was the only road spanning between Tampa and Miami . The builders attempted to construct the road several times before they blasted the muck down to the limestone , filled it with rock and paved over it . Hard rains in the summer caused Lake Okeechobee to rise several feet ; this was noticed by a local newspaper editor who demanded it be lowered . However , on September 16 , 1928 came a massive storm , now known as the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane . Thousands drowned when Lake Okeechobee breached its levees ; the range of estimates of the dead spanned from 1 , 770 according to the Red Cross to 3 , 000 or more . Many were swept away and never recovered . The majority of the dead were black migrant workers who had recently settled in or near Belle Glade . The catastrophe made national news , and although the governor again refused aid , after he toured the area and counted 126 bodies still unburied or uncollected a week after the storm , he activated the National Guard to assist in the cleanup , and declared in a telegram : Without exaggeration , the situation in the storm area beggars description .

The ship participated in the Battle of Jutland , where she was sunk with heavy loss of life . The circumstances under which she sank were mysterious for some years after . As the British had lost contact and did not see the ship destroyed , they were unsure as to whether a submarine or surface ship was responsible for sinking Black Prince . During the battle , the 1st Cruiser Squadron was deployed as part of a screening force several miles ahead of the main force of the Grand Fleet , but Black Prince lost contact with the rest of the Squadron as it came into contact with German forces , at about 17 : 42 . Soon after , two other members of the 1st Cruiser Squadron , Defence and Warrior were heavily engaged by German battleships and battlecruisers , with Defence blowing up and Warrior receiving heavy damage , which later caused her to sink .
Costs . Perhaps the most powerful force driving today s clean - tech growth is simple economics . As a general trend , clean - energy costs are falling as the costs of fossil fuel energy are going up . The future of clean tech is going to be , in many ways , about scaling up manufacturing and driving down costs . 
 It was crazy ! They had film crews and video guys , while I 'm at the board trying to produce . And these guys were running around having a ball , because Mariah and them are laughing and screaming and they 're being interviewed . And I 'm tapping people on the shoulder . We 've got to get to the microphone ! They 're gone in a couple of hours , so I recorded everything they did , praying that it was enough . 
Haifa has developed in tiers , from the lower to the upper city on the Carmel . The oldest neighborhood in the modern Haifa is Wadi Salib , the Old City center near the port , which has been bisected by a major road and razed in part to make way for government buildings . Wadi Salib stretches across to Wadi Nisnas , the center of Arab life in Haifa today . In the 19th century , under Ottoman rule , the German Colony was built , providing the first model of urban planning in Haifa . Some of the buildings have been restored and the colony has turned into a center of Haifa nightlife .
The Chronology of Yue Wumu lists the events at Zhou 's tomb happening in 1121 when Yue was nineteen , but Yue would have been eighteen in that year since he was born on the fifteenth day of the second month of 1103 . The author of the original source material was using xusui age calculation , in which a child is already considered one year old at birth . Since Yue joined the military shortly after Zhou 's death , a relative time frame can be given for when he died . During the early months of 1122 , the Song empire mobilized its armed forces to assist the Jurchen in confronting their common enemy , the Liao Dynasty . Therefore , it appears that Zhou died in late 1121 , before the call to arms was issued .

Adrien Begrand of PopMatters remarked that There 's no better song to kick things off than the masterful ' Angel of Death ' , one of the most monumental songs in metal history , where guitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman deliver their intricate riffs , drummer Dave Lombardo performs some of the most powerful drumming ever recorded , and bassist vocalist Tom Araya screams and snarls his tale of Nazi war criminal Josef Mengele . 
Over the next three months there were violent clashes , with local youths throwing stones at police . Violence came to a head on Saturday , 19 April after a planned march from Burntollet Bridge to the city centre was banned . A protest in the city centre led to clashes with Paisleyites unionists in sympathy with the anti - civil rights stance of Ian Paisley . Police attempting to drive the protesters back into the Bogside were themselves driven back to their barracks . A series of pitched battles followed , and barricades were built , often under the supervision of Bernadette Devlin , newly elected MP for Mid Ulster . Police pursuing rioters broke into a house in William Street and severely beat the occupant , Samuel Devenny , his family and two friends . Devenny was brought to hospital bleeding profusely from a number of head wounds . At midnight four hundred RUC men in full riot gear and carrying riot shields occupied the Bogside . Convoys of police vehicles drove through the area with headlights blazing .

As a self - proclaimed fan of multitracking , Townsend has developed a trademark production style featuring an atmospheric , layered wall of sound . Townsend has drawn critical praise for his productions , which are always marked by a sense of adventure , intrigue , chaotic atmospherics and overall aural pyrotechnics , according to Mike G. of Metal Maniacs . Townsend mainly uses Pro Tools to produce his music , alongside other software suites such as Steinberg Cubase , Ableton Live , and Logic Pro . Townsend 's musical ideas and production style have drawn comparisons to Phil Spector and Frank Zappa . Townsend has carried out the mixing and mastering for most of his solo work himself . He has also mixed and remixed work for other artists such as Rammstein , August Burns Red and Misery Signals .

Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was composed of six constituent republics : Bosnia - Herzegovina , Croatia , Macedonia , Montenegro , Serbia , and Slovenia . In 1991 , Croatia , and Slovenia seceded from Yugoslavia . Bosnia - Herzegovina a republic with a mixed population consisting of Bosniaks , Serbs , and Croats followed suit in March 1992 in a highly controversial referendum , creating tension in the ethnic communities . Bosnian Serb militias , whose strategic goal was to secede from Bosnia and Herzegovina and unite with Serbia , encircled Sarajevo with a siege force of 18 , 000 stationed in the surrounding hills , from which they assaulted the city with weapons that included artillery , mortars , tanks , anti - aircraft guns , heavy machine - guns , rocket launchers , and aircraft bombs . From 2 May 1992 until the end of the war in 1996 , the city was blockaded . The Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , numbering roughly 40 , 000 inside the besieged city , was poorly equipped and unable to break the siege . Meanwhile , throughout the country , thousands of predominantly Bosniak civilians were driven from their homes in a process of ethnic cleansing . In Sarajevo , women and children attempting to buy food were frequently terrorized by Bosnian Serb sniper fire .
The video was directed by Andy Morahan and Eric Watson , and consists of shots of the duo around London . At the beginning of the video , noises from the city can be heard , a camera passes Lowe on the street , and focus on two vintage dolls in a shop window . Then appears a sequence of quick cuts with shots of the city 's different sub - cultures , the video freezes and cuts to Tennant and Lowe , who walk through an empty Wentworth Street in Petticoat Lane Market . They stand in front of a red garage door , Tennant is in front dressed with a long coat , white shirt and dark necktie , directly addressing the camera , with Lowe standing behind him with a blank expression . Lowe is filmed in double - exposure and appears almost ghostlike . In other shots , Tennant walks imperiously while Lowe follows behind , as if one were a master and the other an apprentice .
Activity was somewhat below average in September , with only one tropical cyclone making landfall , Maemi . However , Maemi was the strongest tropical cyclone of the season and was the costliest with roughly US 4 . 8 billion in damage , mostly in South Korea . Tropical cyclogenesis and activity continued to decline after August , with October featuring only three tropical storms . However , two , Ketsana and Parma , reached typhoon intensity ; both stayed away from land . November featured less storms but was climatologically average , with two typhoons developing . The second typhoon , Lupit , devastated portions of Yap State , resulting in approximately 1 . 7 million in damage . In December , the JTWC and PAGASA monitored a sole tropical system east of the Philippines , though the JMA did not monitor or classify any tropical cyclones during the month .
Relay races emerged in the United States in the 1880s as a variation on charity races between firemen , who would hand a red pennant on to team mates every 300 yards . There are two very common relay events : the 4 100 metres relay and the 4 400 metres relay . Both events entered the Olympic programme at the 1912 Summer Games after a one - off men 's medley relay featured in 1908 Olympics . The 4 100 m event is run strictly within the same lane on the track , meaning that the team collectively runs one complete circuit of the track . Teams in a 4 400 m event remain in their own lane until the runner of the second leg passes the first bend , at which point runners can leave their lanes and head towards the inner - most part of the circuit . For the second and third baton change overs , team mates must align themselves in respect of their team position leading teams take the inner lanes while team mates of the slower teams must await the baton on outer lanes .

The game is presented in a isometric format and is set on board a haunted galleon named the Blackwyche . Sir Arthur Pendragon 's main objective is to free the soul of its former captain , Richard Cavendish . Pendragon can utilise various weapons such as knives , daggers and a magic sword to defend himself from enemy skeletons . The player begins the game with full energy and it will slightly deplete every time the player is hit by an enemy . If Pendragon completely runs out of energy , a large skeletal hand will drag the player off - screen , thus killing him .
Motor racing was a world class industry which put Britain at the hi - tech edge . Deprived of tobacco money , Formula One would move abroad at the loss of 50 , 000 jobs , 150 , 000 part - time jobs and 900 million of exports .
A large , conspicuous mushroom , Amanita muscaria is generally common and numerous where it grows , and is often found in groups with basidiocarps in all stages of development . Fly agaric fruiting bodies emerge from the soil looking like white eggs . After emerging from the ground , the cap is covered with numerous small white to yellow pyramid - shaped warts . These are remnants of the universal veil , a membrane that encloses the entire mushroom when it is still very young . Dissecting the mushroom at this stage will reveal a characteristic yellowish layer of skin under the veil ; this is helpful in identification . As the fungus grows , the red colour appears through the broken veil and the warts become less prominent ; they do not change in size , but are reduced relative to the expanding skin area . The cap changes from globose to hemispherical , and finally to plate - like and flat in mature specimens . Fully grown , the bright red cap is usually around 8 20 cm 3 8 in in diameter , although larger specimens have been found . The red colour may fade after rain and in older mushrooms .

The teeth are slender , cylindrical and tapering terete , less than 5 mm 0 . 20 in long , and become shorter closer to the cap edge . They are crowded together , with typically between three and five teeth per square millimeter . Pinkish - white initially , they age to a grayish - brown . The stem is thick , very short , and often deformed . It becomes bulbous where it penetrates the ground , and may root into the soil for several centimeters . Although it may reach up to 5 cm 2 . 0 in in total length , and is 1 to 3 cm 0 . 4 to 1 . 2 in wide , only about 0 . 1 to 1 cm 0 . 0 to 0 . 4 in appear above ground . The upper part is covered with the same teeth found on the underside of the cap , whereas the lower part is hairy and often encases debris from the forest floor . The odor of the fruit body has been described as mild to disagreeable , or , as Banker suggested in his original description , similar to hickory nuts .

In a DVD review of the sixth season , Ryan Keefer said all the Australian jabs you expect to have here are present . Bart 's international incident is hilarious , from top to bottom . The phone calls he makes to other countries particularly Buenos Aires are fantastic . This is one of the more under appreciated episodes in the series ' run . Vanity Fair named it the second best episode of The Simpsons in 2007 . Bart vs. Australia was also nominated for an Emmy Award in 1995 in the category Outstanding Individual Achievement in Sound Mixing for a Comedy Series or a Special .

Although it was the Light Blues ' second consecutive victory , it followed a run of nine consecutive wins for Oxford overall the Dark Blues led 32 24 .
A tropical wave came off the coast of Africa into the eastern Atlantic Ocean on June 10 and 11 . The system moved across the Atlantic and entered into the northeastern Pacific Ocean . The wave became a significant tropical system , with cyclonic turning in the lower and middle layers of the system 's cloudiness on June 25 . The center of circulation was located 345 mi 555 km south of Acapulco , Mexico . The system exhibited sufficient organization to be considered Tropical Depression Five - E on June 26 . The depression quickly strengthened and became Tropical Storm Elida later that day . The track of Elida was west - northwestward to northwestward from June 27 through June 28 . Some rainbands moved over the mountainous region of southwestern Mexico , but no flooding , damage , or casualties were reported as a result . Elida continued strengthening and it was upgraded to a hurricane early on June 28 passing directly over Socorro Island later in the day , right as Elida reached peak strength of 80 mph 130 km h , dropping 3 . 7 in 94 mm of rain on the island . Some windows broke also as a result , and minor structural damage was reported as a result on the island .
Naturally occurring cadmium is composed of 8 isotopes . Two of them are radioactive , and three are expected to decay but have not done so under laboratory conditions . The two natural radioactive isotopes are 113Cd beta decay , half - life is 7 . 7 1015 years and 116Cd two - neutrino double beta decay , half - life is 2 . 9 1019 years . The other three are 106Cd , 108Cd both double electron capture , and 114Cd double beta decay ; only lower limits on these half - lives have been determined . At least three isotopes 110Cd , 111Cd , and 112Cd are stable . Among the isotopes that do not occur naturally , the most long - lived are 109Cd with a half - life of 462 . 6 days , and 115Cd with a half - life of 53 . 46 hours . All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half - lives of less than 2 . 5 hours , and the majority have half - lives of less than 5 minutes . Cadmium has 8 known meta states , with the most stable being 113mCd t1 2

Saprang was sidelined in security plans preceding the Constitutional Tribunal 's 20 May 2007 ruling on the dissolution of the Thai Rak Thai and Democrat Parties . After the 2006 coup , Sonthi had delegated the task of securing Bangkok to Saprang . The pre - ruling plan put Sonthi directly in charge of Bangkok crowd security , allying him with alum of AFPS Class 9 , including Army Chief of Staff General Montri Sangkhasap and First Army Region commander Lt General Prayuth Chan - ocha .
The Type 94 pistol was designed for , and popular among , Japanese tank and aircraft crews who preferred a smaller , lightweight design . Japanese weapons experts have subsequently criticized some design elements of the Type 94 ; in particular the pistol could be fired unintentionally before the breech was fully locked if the sear bar on the side of the receiver was jarred loose and the pistol was improperly handled . Additionally , the process to disassemble the pistol is overly complex and awkward . The build quality of the Type 94 pistol declined over its production run ; last ditch pistols made in 1945 were crudely manufactured .
The female kakapo lays 1 or 2 eggs rarely 3 per breeding cycle , with long intervals between laying of first and second eggs . She nests on the ground under the cover of plants or in cavities such as hollow tree trunks . The female incubates the eggs faithfully , but is forced to leave them every night in search of food . Predators are known to eat the eggs and the embryos inside can also die of cold in the mother 's absence . Kakapo eggs usually hatch within 30 days , bearing fluffy grey chicks that are quite helpless . After the eggs hatch , the female feeds the chicks for three months , and the chicks remain with the female for some months after fledging . The young chicks are just as vulnerable to predators as the eggs , and young have been killed by many of the same predators that attack adults . Chicks leave the nest at approximately 10 to 12 weeks of age . As they gain greater independence , their mothers may feed the chicks sporadically for up to 6 months .
The Bronze Age defined by the use of metal began around 2500 BC , with technology changing people 's everyday lives during this period through innovations such as the wheel , harnessing oxen , weaving textiles , brewing alcohol , and skilful metalworking , which produced new weapons and tools , along with fine gold decoration and jewellery , such as brooches and torcs . According to John T. Koch and others , Ireland in the Late Bronze Age was part of a maritime trading - networked culture called the Atlantic Bronze Age that also included Britain , western France and Iberia , and that this is where Celtic languages developed . This contrasts with the traditional view that their origin lies in mainland Europe with the Hallstatt culture .
The relationship between John of Brienne and Hugh I of Cyprus was tense . Hugh ordered the imprisonment of John 's supporters in Cyprus , releasing them only at Pope Innocent 's command . During the War of the Antiochene Succession John sided with Bohemond IV of Antioch and the Templars against Raymond - Roupen of Antioch and Leo I , King of Cilician Armenia , who were supported by Hugh and the Hospitallers . However , John sent only 50 knights to fight the Armenians in Antiochia in 1213 . Leo I concluded a peace treaty with the Knights Templar late that year , and he and John reconciled . John married Leo 's oldest daughter , Stephanie also known as Rita , in 1214 and Stephanie received a dowry of 30 , 000 bezants . Quarrels among John , Leo I , Hugh I and Bohemond IV are documented by Pope Innocent 's letters urging them to reconcile their differences before the Fifth Crusade reached the Holy Land .
An increasing level of criminal violence prompted Ambassador Bishop to request the voluntary evacuation of dependents e.g. children and spouses of staff and non - essential staff in early December , although fighting between the government and the United Somali Congress a rebel militia remained no less than about 100 miles 160 km away . The voluntary evacuation later became a mandatory evacuation . By 19 December , the number of official US personnel in the city was reduced from 147 to 37 ; around the same time , fighting between the government and rebels came within about 40 miles 64 km of Mogadishu .

The Commandments appear in the earliest Church writings ; the Catechism states that they have occupied a predominant place in teaching the faith since the time of Augustine of Hippo AD 354 430 . The Church had no official standards for religious instruction until the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 ; evidence suggests the Commandments were used in Christian education in the early Church and throughout the Middle Ages , but with inconsistent emphasis . The lack of instruction in them by some dioceses formed the basis of one of the criticisms launched against the Church by Protestant reformers . Afterward , the first Church - wide catechism in 1566 provided thorough discussions of each commandment , but gave greater emphasis to the seven sacraments . The most recent Catechism devotes a large section to interpret each of the commandments .
Most phylogenetic analyses of temnospondyl interrelationships focus on individual families . One of the first broad - scale studies of temnospondyl phylogeny was conducted by paleontologist Andrew Milner in 1990 . A 2007 study made a supertree of all temnospondyl families , combining the family - level trees of previous studies . The following cladogram is modified from Ruta et al . 2007 :
The second season , in 1945 , featured two double bills . The first consisted of Henry IV , Parts 1 and 2 . Olivier played the warrior Hotspur in the first and the doddering Justice Shallow in the second . He received good notices , but by general consent the production belonged to Richardson as Falstaff . In the second double bill it was Olivier who dominated , in the title roles of Oedipus Rex and The Critic . In the two one - act plays his switch from searing tragedy and horror in the first half to farcical comedy in the second impressed most critics and audience members , though a minority felt that the transformation from Sophocles 's bloodily blinded hero to Sheridan 's vain and ludicrous Mr Puff smacked of a quick - change turn in a music hall . After the London season the company played both the double bills and Uncle Vanya in a six - week run on Broadway .
Monument 23 is sculpted from andesite and falls in the middle of the size range for confirmed colossal heads . It stands 1 . 84 metres 6 . 0 ft high and measures 1 . 2 metres 3 . 9 ft wide by 1 . 56 metres 5 . 1 ft deep . Like the examples from the Olmec heartland , the monument features a flat back . Lee Parsons contests John Graham 's identification of Monument 23 as a re - carved colossal head ; he views the side ornaments , identified by Graham as ears , as rather the scrolled eyes of an open - jawed monster gazing upwards . Countering this , James Porter has claimed that the re - carving of the face of a colossal head into a niche figure is clearly evident .
Perfect Dark is a first - person shooter with elements of stealth games . In the game 's campaign mode , the player controls Joanna Dark through a series of nonlinear levels collected together into missions . Each level requires the player to complete a certain number of objectives , ranging from disguising oneself to hacking computers , collecting objects , and defeating enemies , among others . Players can carry an unlimited number of weapons and almost all of the weapons have two firing modes . The levels in Perfect Dark have no checkpoints , meaning that if Joanna is killed or fails an objective , the player has to start the level from the beginning . Every level can be played on three difficulty settings and several aspects , such as the enemies aggressiveness and the number of objectives that must be completed , among others , can vary in function of the chosen difficulty . Two players can also play the campaign co - operatively or through a counter - operative mode , in which one player controls the protagonist , while the other controls enemies throughout the level , attempting to stop the first player from completing objectives .

While industry remains important to the city , about a third of Lock Haven 's workforce is employed in education , health care , or social services .
Following a 10 - year break from music , Jackson signed with her brother Michael 's record label , MJJ Music , in 1997 . From the label , Yours Faithfully was released on March 31 , 1998 . The album featured a remixed version of Jackson 's successful Centipede . Initially , the singer had not wanted to feature the track , believing that it was part of the past . After thinking about it for a while , Jackson felt that the inclusion of the remix which features a rap by son Austin would be a good way to return to the music scene . In addition , two of her other children , Stacee and Yashi , contributed backing vocals for the album .

Vibe magazine 's Quohnos Mitchell expressed disappointment in the album , labelling its content a mix of dated R B grooves dressed up with a few cleverly placed samples .
Some people with AML may experience swelling of the gums because of infiltration of leukemic cells into the gum tissue . Rarely , the first sign of leukemia may be the development of a solid leukemic mass or tumor outside of the bone marrow , called a chloroma . Occasionally , a person may show no symptoms , and the leukemia may be discovered incidentally during a routine blood test .
The common starling is a highly gregarious species , especially in autumn and winter . Although flock size is highly variable , huge , noisy flocks - murmurations - may form near roosts . These dense concentrations of birds are thought to be a defence against attacks by birds of prey such as peregrine falcons or Eurasian sparrowhawks . Flocks form a tight sphere - like formation in flight , frequently expanding and contracting and changing shape , seemingly without any sort of leader . Each common starling changes its course and speed as a result of the movement of its closest neighbours . Very large roosts , exceptionally up to 1 . 5 million birds , can form in city centres , woodlands or reedbeds , causing problems with their droppings . These may accumulate up to 30 cm 12 in deep , killing trees by their concentration of chemicals . In smaller amounts , the droppings act as a fertiliser , and therefore woodland managers may try to move roosts from one area of a wood to another to benefit from the soil enhancement and avoid large toxic deposits .

The example of the ironclads had some bearing on the history of the tank , as ironclad warships became an inspiration for ideas of landships and other armored vehicles . H. G. Wells , in his short story The Land Ironclads , published in The Strand Magazine in December 1903 , described the use of large , armoured cross - country vehicles , armed with cannon and machine guns , and equipped with pedrail wheels

Markgraf struck a pair of mines in quick succession while in the Irben Strait and took in 260 metric tons 260 long tons ; 290 short tons of water . The ship continued on to Kiel via Neufahrwasser in Danzig ; she then went on to Wilhelmshaven , where the mine damage was repaired . The work was completed at the Imperial Dockyard from 6 to 23 November . After repairs were completed , Markgraf returned to guard duty in the North Sea . She missed an attempted raid on a British convoy on 23 25 April 1918 , as she was in dock in Kiel from 15 March to 5 May for the installation of a new foremast .
The issue of synonyms is complicated by the type specimen of Allosaurus fragillis catalogue number YPM 1930 being extremely fragmentary , consisting of a few incomplete vertebrae , limb bone fragments , rib fragments , and a tooth . Because of this , several scientists have noted that the type specimen , and thus the genus Allosaurus itself or at least the species A. fragillis , is technically a nomen dubium dubious name , based on a specimen too incomplete to compare to other specimens or to classify . In an attempt to fix this situation , Gregory S. Paul and Kenneth Carpenter 2010 submitted a petition to the ICZN to have the name A. fragillis officially transferred to the more complete specimen USNM4734 as a neotype . This request is currently pending review .
Fish and Shawn McGrath collaborated on a puzzle game that became Fez . When McGrath left the project due to creative differences , Fish , the game 's artist , pursued a platform game direction with Renaud B dard , the game 's programmer , who wrote the game 's level editor and game engine from scratch . Levels were built in 3D by extruding surfaces with Photoshop - created textures . B dard and Fish were joined by three different animators and other collaborators . The game was first announced in June 2007 and won an award at the 2008 Independent Games Festival and entered the public spotlight . Fish created a studio , Polytron Corporation , and was later aided by nearby developer - publisher Trapdoor when Polytron ran out of money . Fez won several more prerelease awards , including the 2012 Seumas McNally Grand Prize .

The album received generally favorable reviews . The New Yorker commented that Dylan had welded a pre - rock musical sound to some of his croakiest vocals in a while , and speculated that Dylan 's intentions might be ironic : Dylan has a long and highly publicized history with Christianity ; to claim there 's not a wink in the childish optimism of ' Here Comes Santa Claus ' or ' Winter Wonderland ' is to ignore a half - century of biting satire . In USA Today , Edna Gundersen pointed out that Dylan was revisiting yuletide styles popularized by Nat King Cole , Mel Torm , and the Ray Conniff Singers . Gundersen concluded that Dylan couldn 't sound more sentimental or sincere .

At West Palm Beach , the majority of the damage was confined to vegetation . Several coconut and royal palms that withstood the 1928 hurricane snapped , littering streets with broken trunks . Winds downed road signs on many streets , and floodwaters covered the greens on a local golf course . Some garages and isolated structures , mostly lightweight , were partly or totally destroyed , along with a lumber warehouse . Some homes that lost roofing shingles had water damage to their interiors as well . Nearby Lake Worth sustained extensive breakage of windows , including plate glass , and loss of tile and shingle roofing , but preparations reduced losses to just several thousand dollars , and no post - storm accidents took place . Strong winds snapped many light poles in the city , and trees and shrubs were broken or uprooted . As in Lake Worth , officials in West Palm Beach credited preparations and stringent building codes with reducing overall damage . The city had learned from previous experience with severe storms in 1926 , 1928 , and 1929 . High tides eroded Ocean Boulevard at several spots and disrupted access to several bridges on the Lake Worth Lagoon . Winter estates and hotels on Palm Beach generally sustained little material damage , except to vegetation , and county properties went largely unscathed .
The game received mixed reviews upon release . A reviewer of CVG thought the graphics were identical to its predecessor , Entombed , and criticised the low detail of the player - character , Sir Arthur Pendragon . Eugene Lacey of Commodore User praised the graphics , stating that they were smoother and slightly more detailed , despite acknowledging that they appeared similar to its predecessor . Stuart Cooke of Your Commodore thought the graphics were too repetitive and stated that he had trouble determining which section of the game he was on due to the similarities of all the colours . Reviewers of Zzap ! 64 criticised the graphics , stating the sprites to be awful , and animation as crummy with little or no range of colouring . The sprite of Sir Arthur Pendragon was frequently criticised by reviewers of Zzap ! 64 , with one reviewer expressing frustration on why Ultimate continued to re - use the same sprites in their games . Another reviewer condemned the 3D animation , stating that it appeared out of proportion and frustrating . Tony Hetherington of Computer Gamer similarly criticised the graphics , owing to the duplicated landscapes and identical usage of colours , concluding that it was a disappointing game .
... it was apparent to a judge of the game that something was wrong with the Maori , as they were not showing their usual dash and combination . Four members of the team were suspended , a charge being made against them of attempting the sell the match . The matter was bought before the Otago Union , who passed the following resolution : That , having heard all available evidence regarding the charges against certain members of the Native Team , and having received an explicit denial of charges from the accused members and a satisfactory explanation from the management , we are of opinion that there are no facts before us justifying the allegations ...
Route 29 was initially designated in 1927 to run from downtown Trenton to Newark , following present - day Route 179 and US 202 between Lambertville and Somerville and US 22 between Somerville and Newark . The route between Lambertville and Frenchtown was originally Route 29A . In 1953 , Route 29 was shifted to follow the alignment of Route 29A to avoid the concurrencies with the U.S. Routes . Route 29 between South Warren Street in Trenton and I - 95 in Ewing Township was upgraded to a four - lane highway , with a portion of freeway , in the 1950s and 1960s . In 1995 , the southern freeway part of Route 29 between I - 195 I - 295 and Route 129 in Hamilton Township was completed . This freeway section was linked to the rest of Route 29 by a tunnel completed in 2002 . A realignment of Route 29 in Lambertville by the 2000s made the route concurrent with the entire length of 0 . 26 - mile - long 0 . 42 km Route 165 .

King Narathihapate is unkindly remembered in Burmese history as Taruk - Pye Min , the King who Fled from the Taruk .
Daydream received universal acclaim at the time of its release . Reviews applauded the little changes of style from previous Carey releases , some of whom adding that it is her best record , while others dismissed it as soulless and lacking of originality . AllMusic 's senior editor , Stephen Thomas Erlewine , awarded the album four and a half out of five stars . Erlewine called Daydream her best record yet and wrote , Mariah Carey certainly knows how to construct an album . Positioning herself directly between urban R B with tracks like Fantasy , and the adult contemporary radio format with songs like One Sweet Day , a duet with Boyz II Men , Carey appeals to both audiences equally because of the sheer amount of craft and hard work she puts into her albums . Daydream is her best record to date , featuring a consistently strong selection of songs and a remarkably impassioned performance by Carey . Daydream demonstrates that Carey continues to perfect her craft , and that she has earned her status as an R B pop diva . In his review for the album , Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly called Daydream her best record since her 1990 debut , writing , in fact , it 's easily the best collection Carey has put out since her self - titled 1990 debut , the album Daydream most resembles in its emphasis on R B grooves . Tucker specifically complimented One Sweet Day , Always Be My Baby , Forever , and Daydream Interlude Fantasy Sweet Dub Mix , writing One Sweet Day , her collaboration with Boyz II Men , radiates a breezy sexiness that Carey , for all the brazen hussiness of her public persona , rarely permits herself to reveal in song . I like the relaxed swing of Always Be My Baby , and the brisk waltz tempo of Forever . However , it 's on what many Carey fans will probably find the most throwaway cut , Daydream Interlude Fantasy Sweet Dub Mix , that the singer really defines herself . At her best , as she is on this clipped , spunky track , Carey is a disco diva for the ' 90s , a worthy successor to trailblazing women like Donna Summer and Vicki Sue Robinson , R B singers with an affinity for the endless groove .

With the exception of Marie and Polo , these systems developed between 5 and 15 N , east of the longitude of Baja California in the climatologically favored area for tropical cyclogenesis . After their development , most of the tropical cyclones moved on a west to northwest track and dissipated over cool waters without affecting land . Rachel was the only system to make landfall . In addition , one tropical storm formed in the Central Pacific and eventually crossed the International Dateline before dissipating .
For the 2010 2011 academic year , Florida Atlantic had approximately 300 registered student organizations . Among the groups are academic organizations , honor societies , spiritual religious organizations , diversity - appreciation organizations , service organizations , personal interest organizations , sports clubs , and student government agencies . These clubs and organizations run the gamut from sailing to Ultimate Frisbee , from varsity and club sports and a jazz group to a pottery guild , from political organizations to chess and video game clubs . These organizations are funded by student tuition , from which 10 . 00 per credit hour goes toward an activities and service fee fund . This generates approximately 9 million that is then given to student government for allocation to student clubs and organizations . The student government also finances other student life programs , including career fairs , the University Press , OWL TV and Owl Radio , and Homecoming .

The development of an enantioselective Nazarov cyclization is a desirable addition to the repertoire of Nazarov cyclization reactions . To that end , several variations have been developed utilizing chiral auxiliaries and chiral catalysts . Diastereoselective cyclizations are also known , in which extant stereocenters direct the cyclization . Almost all of the attempts are based on the idea of torquoselectivity ; selecting one direction for the vinyl groups to rotate in turn sets the stereochemistry as shown below .

Together , Schmitt , Kutuzov and the other generals , with von Stiebar 's advice on the local terrain , concocted a plan to encircle the French at D renstein . Russian commander Mikhail Andreyevich Miloradovich would approach Gazan 's division from the east , supported by Petr Bagration 's corps , and pin the French in place . Three additional columns , commanded by Dmitry Dokhturov Doctorov , Maj. Gen. Strik and Schmitt , would outflank the French from the west and the north . They would offer , as bait , a rumor : the Russian army was retreating into Moravia and only a rearguard would be left at Krems .
Investigation in Yellowstone National Park showed that elk , followed by mule deer , were the cougar 's primary targets ; the prey base is shared with the park 's gray wolves , with which the cougar competes for resources . Another study on winter kills November April in Alberta showed that ungulates accounted for greater than 99 of the cougar diet . Learned , individual prey recognition was observed , as some cougars rarely killed bighorn sheep , while others relied heavily on the species .

The discovery of Iguanodon has long been accompanied by a popular legend . The story goes that Gideon Mantell 's wife , Mary Ann , discovered the first teeth of an Iguanodon in the strata of Tilgate Forest in Whitemans Green , Cuckfield , Sussex , England , in 1822 while her husband was visiting a patient . However , there is no evidence that Mantell took his wife with him while seeing patients . Furthermore , he admitted in 1851 that he himself had found the teeth . Not everyone agrees that the story is false , though . It is known from his notebooks that Mantell first acquired large fossil bones from the quarry at Whitemans Green in 1820 . Because also theropod teeth were found , thus belonging to carnivores , he at first interpreted these bones , which he tried to combine into a partial skeleton , as those of a giant crocodile . In 1821 Mantell mentioned the find of herbivorous teeth and began to consider the possibility that a large herbivorous reptile was present in the strata . However , in his 1822 publication Fossils of the South Downs he as yet did not dare to suggest a connection between the teeth and his very incomplete skeleton , presuming that his finds presented two large forms , one carnivorous an animal of the Lizard Tribe of enormous magnitude , the other herbivorous . In May 1822 he first presented the herbivorous teeth to the Royal Society of London but the members , among them William Buckland , dismissed them as fish teeth or the incisors of a rhinoceros from a Tertiary stratum . On 23 June 1823 Charles Lyell showed some to Georges Cuvier , during a soiree in Paris , but the famous French naturalist at once dismissed them as those of a rhinoceros . Though the very next day Cuvier retracted , Lyell reported only the dismissal to Mantell , who became rather diffident about the issue . In 1824 Buckland described Megalosaurus and was on that occasion invited to visit Mantell 's collection . Seeing the bones on 6 March he agreed that these were of some giant saurian though still denying it was a herbivore . Emboldened nevertheless , Mantell again sent some teeth to Cuvier , who answered on 22 June 1824 that he had determined that they were reptilian and quite possibly belonged to a giant herbivore . In a new edition that year of his Recherches sur les Ossemens Fossiles Cuvier admitted his earlier mistake , leading to an immediate acceptance of Mantell , and his new saurian , in scientific circles . Mantell tried to corroborate his theory further by finding a modern - day parallel among extant reptiles . In September 1824 he visited the Royal College of Surgeons but at first failed to find comparable teeth . However , assistant - curator Samuel Stutchbury recognised that they resembled those of an iguana he had recently prepared , albeit twenty times longer .

Personal interaction with the gods took many forms . People who wanted information or advice consulted oracles , run by temples , that were supposed to convey gods ' answers to questions . Amulets and other images of protective deities were used to ward off the demons that might threaten human well - being or to impart the god 's positive characteristics to the wearer . Private rituals invoked the gods ' power to accomplish personal goals , from healing sickness to cursing enemies . These practices used heka , the same force of magic that the gods used , which the creator was said to have given to humans so they could fend off misfortune . The performer of a private rite often took on the role of a god in a myth , or even threatened a deity , to involve the gods in accomplishing the goal . Such rituals coexisted with private offerings and prayers , and all three were accepted means of obtaining divine help .

Binary and multi - star systems consist of two or more stars that are gravitationally bound and generally move around each other in stable orbits . When two such stars have a relatively close orbit , their gravitational interaction can have a significant impact on their evolution . Stars can form part of a much larger gravitationally bound structure , such as a star cluster or a galaxy .
In 1993 , Vandernoot wanted to leave the show because shooting Highlander was too demanding and required her to spend several months each year in Canada . Vandernoot also wanted to spend more time with her family . According to Abramowitz , a further , artistic , reason was that ... a small part of Vandernoot being a really strong actress wanted to play a more aggressive part in the show and sadly , the nature of the beast was that it couldn 't happen and she made a decision . Panzer said that creating interesting female characters in the Highlander franchise was often a challenge because the producers found it difficult to ... have the women be something other than a victim , a hostage , other things when one is dealing with an immortal hero . Consequently , the creative staff needed to write Tessa out of the show but were restricted because of the character 's strong relationship with MacLeod . Associate Creative Consultant Gillian Horvath said that , There was no way ... to have a scene where she said , ' Okay , I 'm going to go to Paris without you . Nice knowing you , MacLeod . ' The writers decided that the only solution was for Tessa to die , despite Abramowitz 's feeling that her death was ... sad and ... heartbreaking .
Not all relations between Egypt and its neighbors were peaceful during Djedkare 's reign . In particular , one of the earliest known depictions of a battle or city being besieged is found in the tomb of Inti , an official from the 21st nome of Upper Egypt , who lived during the late Fifth Dynasty . The scene shows Egyptian soldiers scaling the walls of a near eastern fortress on ladders . More generally , ancient Egyptians seem to have regularly organised punitive raids in Canaan during the later Old Kingdom period but did not attempt to establish a permanent dominion there .

An intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success . By this definition , simple programs that solve specific problems are intelligent agents , as are human beings and organizations of human beings , such as firms . The intelligent agent paradigm defines AI research as the study of intelligent agents . This is a generalization of some earlier definitions of AI : it goes beyond studying human intelligence ; it studies all kinds of intelligence .
A tropical disturbance persisted in the monsoon trough northwest of Pohnpei on June 7 , and moved westward without development due to wind shear . On June 11 , the shear decreased enough to allow the convection to organize , and the next day the JMA classified it as a tropical depression northeast of Palau . On June 13 , the JMA upgraded it to Tropical Storm Soudelor to the east of the Philippines , and PAGASA gave it the local name Egay . Soudelor moved to the northwest and later to the north , parallel to the eastern Philippines , and on June 17 , the JMA upgraded it to typhoon status . The storm rapidly intensified to the east of Taiwan as it developed a well - defined eye , and while doing so passed over the Japanese island of Iriomote - jima at around 2030 UTC on June 17 . At 0600 UTC on June 18 , the JTWC estimated peak 1 minute winds of 215 km h 135 mph , while the JMA estimated peak 10 minute winds of 150 km h 90 mph . Increased shear weakened the typhoon to tropical storm strengthen on June 19 , and later that day the JMA declared the storm as extratropical near the Oki Islands . The extratropical remnants of Soudelor continued to the northeast , crossing northern Japan on June 20 and dissipating on June 24 .
Described as a masterpiece of Gupta - Chalukyan art , the most important sculpture in the caves is the Trimurti , carved in relief at the back of the cave facing the entrance , on the north - south axis . It is also known as Trimurti Sadashiva and Maheshmurti . The image , 6 m 20 ft in height , depicts a three - headed Shiva , representing Panchamukha Shiva . The three heads are said to represent three essential aspects of Shiva : creation , protection , and destruction . The right half - face west face shows him as a young person with sensuous lips , embodying life and its vitality . In his hand he holds an object resembling a rosebud , depicting the promise of life and creativity . This face is closest to that of Brahma , the creator or Uma or Vamadeva , the feminine side of Shiva and creator of joy and beauty . The left half - face east face is that of a moustached young man , displaying anger . This is Shiva as the terrifying Aghora or Bhairava , the one whose anger can engulf the entire world in flames , leaving only ashes behind . This is also known as Rudra - Shiva , the Destroyer . The central face , benign and meditative , resembles the preserver Vishnu . This is Tatpurusha , master of positive and negative principles of existence and preserver of their harmony or Shiva as the yogi Yogeshwar in deep meditation praying for the preservation of humanity . The aspects Sadyojata and Ishana not carved faces are considered to be at the back and top of the sculpture . The Trimurti sculpture , with the Gateway of India in the background , has been adopted as the logo of the Maharashtra Tourism Department MTDC .
In 1954 , Wilhelm was a key piece of the pitching staff that led the 1954 Giants to a world championship . He pitched 111 innings , finishing with a 12 4 record and a 2 . 10 ERA .

In Egyptian belief , names express the fundamental nature of the things to which they refer . In keeping with this belief , the names of deities often relate to their roles or origins . The name of the predatory goddess Sekhmet means powerful one , the name of the mysterious god Amun means hidden one , and the name of the goddess Nekhbet , who was worshipped in the city of Nekheb , means she of Nekheb . But many other names have no certain meaning , even when the gods who bear them are closely tied to a single role . The names of the sky goddess Nut and the earth god Geb do not resemble the Egyptian terms for sky and earth .

Opposite the Airborne Cemetery is a civilian graveyard with a small Commonwealth War Graves Commission plot containing the graves of nine airmen shot down shortly before the battle . It is also home to Lipmann Kessel , a surgeon with the 16th Parachute Field Ambulance during the battle , who wished to be buried near his men after his death in 1986 . Similarly , the Moscowa Cemetery three miles east contains the graves of thirty six aircrew killed before the battle , and one unidentified soldier . Not all of the Allied dead from the Battle of Arnhem are interred at the cemetery . Some 300 men who were killed when flying into battle , while trying to escape or who succumbed to wounds later , are buried in civilian cemeteries in the Netherlands , Belgium , the UK and the USA . Sixty men who died in prisoner of war camps after the battle are buried in Germany .
On 21 June 2008 , Stuart Hill , the owner and only resident of the 1 hectare 2 . 5 acres island of Forewick Holm which he has renamed Forvik Island made a declaration of dependence , creating the Crown Dependency of Forvik . On the basis of a marriage arrangement between King Christian of Norway and King James III of Scotland that dates to 1468 , Hill argued that the island should be considered a British crown dependency , and thus not a part of the United Kingdom or of the European Union . This claim was not recognised by the United Kingdom .
NY 3 was realigned c . 1932 to follow Saunders Settlement Road between Shawnee Road NY 425 and Upper Mountain Road . The former routing of NY 3 along Shawnee , Lower Mountain , Gothic Hill , and Upper Mountain roads was redesignated as NY 3A even though all of NY 3 's former routing was already part of either NY 425 or NY 93 . The NY 3A designation was eliminated c . 1935 when NY 3 was truncated eastward to a new western terminus in central New York . In the early 1940s , NY 93 was altered to follow North Ridge Road , U.S. Route 104 now NY 104 , and Junction Road between North Ridge and Lower Mountain Road .
At 19 : 03 , Marlborough engaged Wiesbaden again , firing four salvos at ranges of 9 , 500 to 9 , 800 yards 8 , 700 to 9 , 000 m . She hit the German cruiser with probably three shells from the last two salvos and these finally neutralised the ship , although it took several more hours before Wiesbaden sank . Marlborough then shifted fire to the K nig - class battleships leading the German line at 19 : 12 . She fired thirteen salvos in the span of six minutes at SMS Grosser Kurf rst at ranges of 10 , 200 to 10 , 750 yards 9 , 330 to 9 , 830 m , scoring three hits , though she incorrectly claimed a fourth hit . During this phase of the battle , Marlborough fired two torpedoes , both of which missed their targets : the first at Wiesbaden at 19 : 10 and the second at SMS Kaiser at 19 : 25 .
Amos made his first start of the 2011 12 season in a third round League Cup tie at Elland Road against Leeds United . He kept a clean sheet as United cruised through to the next round winning 3 0 . He played again in the following round away at Aldershot Town , a game which United also won 3 0 and advanced to the quarter finals . He was in goal again for United 's League Cup game in a defeat against Championship club Crystal Palace on 30 November . It also seemed that he had moved above last season 's second choice Tomasz Kuszczak in the pecking order , but was now third choice behind Anders Lindegaard and David de Gea . He made his first Premier League start in a 2 0 home win against Stoke City on 31 January 2012 , keeping a clean sheet on his debut .

Since the Song dynasty , critics have called Du Fu the poet historian sh sh . The most directly historical of his poems are those commenting on military tactics or the successes and failures of the government , or the poems of advice which he wrote to the emperor . Indirectly , he wrote about the effect of the times in which he lived on himself , and on the ordinary people of China . As Watson notes , this is information of a kind seldom found in the officially compiled histories of the era .
Official religion involved a variety of rituals , based in temples . Some rites were performed every day , whereas others were festivals , taking place at longer intervals and often limited to a particular temple or deity . The gods received their offerings in daily ceremonies , in which their statues were clothed , anointed , and presented with food as hymns were recited in their honor . These offerings , in addition to maintaining maat for the gods , celebrated deities ' life - giving generosity and encouraged them to remain benevolent rather than vengeful .
The change in combat systems was not the only difference between Barbarian II and its predecessor that influenced reviewers ' opinions about the sequel . The first Barbarian game was enjoyed by reviewers for providing exciting head - to - head action between two players . Barbarian II abandoned this , setting up an adventuring experience for the single player . Jim Douglas , reviewing for Sinclair User , doubted that players who were looking for quick action would appreciate plotting a path through the maze to reach the final goal . Your Sinclair 's Marcus Berkmann felt the two genres slash ' em up and arcade adventure were fundamentally incompatible , agreeing with Douglas that the maze was a distraction . Crash 's reviewers , however , felt the combination of genres made the game interesting . James Price wrote in Amiga Force that the adventuring element and unending number of enemies made Barbarian II a far better game than the first , while The Games Machine 's staff said the expanded menagerie of foes adequately made up for a reduction in combat moves .

Much of the development , and many of the buildings , were the vision of John Wood , the Elder . The Circus is seen as the pinnacle of Wood 's work . It consists of three long , curved terraces that form a circular space or theatre intended for civic functions and games . The games give a clue to the design , the inspiration for which was the Colosseum in Rome . The best known of Bath 's terraces is the Royal Crescent , built between 1767 and 1774 and designed by Wood 's son , John Wood , the Younger . Around 1770 the neoclassical architect Robert Adam designed Pulteney Bridge , a three - arched bridge spanning the Avon . He used as his prototype an original , but unused , design by Palladio for the Rialto Bridge in Venice . The heart of the Georgian city was the Pump Room , which together with its associated Lower Assembly Rooms was designed by Thomas Baldwin , a local builder responsible for many other buildings in the city , including the terraces in Argyle Street . Great Pulteney Street , where Baldwin eventually lived , is another of his works : this wide boulevard , constructed c . 1789 and over 1 , 000 feet 305 m long and 100 feet 30 m wide , is lined on both sides by Georgian terraces .
Kouma 's patrol was then ambushed by a group of North Koreans dressed in US military uniforms . Kouma was wounded and the other three vehicles had to withdraw , but he held the Agok site until 07 : 30 the next morning with his single tank .

Composed and written in a year , the record marks Arjona and Torres ' fourth collaboration . For Independiente , Arjona returns to his trademark sound after his stylistic departure for Poquita Ropa 2010 . While producing the latter , he had used fewer instruments to simplify his sound , having introduced what had been called a stripped - down acoustic effort in his music . Independiente has been compared to his earlier recordings , Historias 1994 and Animal Nocturno 1993 .
Before 1983 , US 2 used a different routing through Manistique and crossed the Manistique River on what is nicknamed the Siphon Bridge . Built as a part of a raceway flume on the river , the water level is actually higher than the road surface . This produces a siphon effect , giving the bridge its nickname . The Manistique Pulp and Paper Company was organized in 1916 and needed a dam on the Manistique River to supply their mill . This dam would require a large section of the city to be flooded , and shallow river banks meant difficulties in any bridge construction . Instead of expensive dikes , a concrete tank was built lengthwise in the river bed ; the sides of this tank provided man - made banks higher than the natural banks . The Michigan Works Progress Administration described the bridge as having concrete bulkheads , formed by the side spans of the bridge , that allow the mill to maintain the water level several feet above the roadbed . The Manistique Tourism Council stated : At one time , the bridge itself was partially supported by the water that was atmospherically forced under it , and that the bridge has been featured in Ripley 's Believe It or Not ! . The eight - span structure is 294 feet 90 m long .

Besides fishing , the Plunketts Creek watershed contains much of the 6 , 722 acres 27 . 20 km2 of Pennsylvania State Game Lands No. 134 , in both Lycoming and Sullivan counties . Habitat is found there for deer , ruffed grouse , and wild turkey . Hunting , trapping , and fishing are possible with proper licenses on both the state forest and State Game Lands . Camping , hiking , mountain bike and horseback riding , snowmobiling , cross - country skiing , and bird watching are all possible on state forest lands . The southern end of the 27 . 1 mile 43 . 6 km long Old Loggers Path , a loop hiking trail , runs through the watershed just north of Engle and Wolf Runs .
DuVall revealed in September 2010 that Alice in Chains had not begun writing their next album yet , but there 's plenty of riffs flying around . He added , That was the case when we first started back up . We would just stockpile these fragments , and then some time later we would sift through the mountain of stuff , and that 's what became Black Gives Way to Blue . The same thing has been happening since we 've been touring Black Gives Way to Blue , so it would be only natural to at some point say , ' Hey , we 've got a lot of stuff . Let 's sift through and see what we 've got this time . ' DuVall also mentioned that it was possible that the new album would feature songs that were written for Black Gives Way to Blue .
 Rockstar 101 received mixed responses from music critics . Brian Linder for IGN praised the song , writing that it actually works despite sounding disjointed at first . Emily Tartanella of PopMatters defined Rockstar 101 as a brilliant bit of bravado during her review of Rated R , while Ailbhe Malone for NME wrote that Rihanna sings with swagger on the track , which was something that she has Hova to thank for . Jon Pareles for The New York Times simply highlighted a line from the song , I never play the victim . Neil McCormick for The Daily Telegraph thought that Rockstar 101 was one of the few songs on the album to retain the vaguest leftover hints of her warm Caribbean vocal flavouring . Ann Powers for the Los Angeles Times was critical of Slash 's inclusion on the song , and she described it as an afterthought . Powers wrote she can definitely get by without that ultimate rock phallic symbol , a reference to Slash . Pitchfork Media 's Ryan Dombell felt that Rockstar 101 , alike Russian Roulette and The Last Song , were instantly - dated missteps from a bygone era when a Slash feature was cool . He further wrote that Rockstar 101 and G4L were harder to justify considering their mindless boasts and torpid production . The song was met with a negative review from The Guardian 's Alex Petridis , who wrote At one extreme , the resemblance of ' Umbrella ' ' s chorus to that of a stadium rock ballad seems to have encouraged Rihanna to cut out the middle - man and just start making stadium rock : cue the awful widdly - woo guitars of ' Rockstar 101 ' and ' Fire Bomb ' .
The earthquake caused an urgent need for outside rescuers to communicate with Haitians whose main or only language is Haitian Creole . As a result , a mobile translation program to translate between English and Haitian Creole had to be written quickly .

Falling back to a secure position on Monument Hill , the Americans repulsed several vigorous British assaults , although Colonel Francis was hit in the arm by a shot . He soldiered on , directing troops to a perceived weakness on Fraser 's left . The tide of the battle turned when , after more than an hour of battle , Riedesel 's grenadiers arrived . These disciplined forces entered the fray singing hymns to the accompaniment of a military band to make them appear more numerous than they actually were . The American flanks were turned , and they were forced to make a desperate race across an open field to avoid being enveloped . Colonel Francis fell in a volley of musket fire as the troops raced away from the advancing British and scattered into the countryside .

Steiner wrote The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H. in 1975 and 1976 in Geneva , Switzerland , and the 120 - page work originally appeared in the Spring 1979 issue of the United States literary magazine , The Kenyon Review . It also appeared in the Spring 1980 issue of Granta , the British literary magazine . Its first publication in book form , with minor revisions by Steiner , was in May 1981 by Faber and Faber in the United Kingdom and as requested by Steiner , it was a paperback original . The first United States edition was published in hardcover in April 1982 by Simon Schuster .

In March 1943 an ammunition dump was blown up by Calvo 's agents . The British , growing suspicious of some of the saboteurs , banned them from entering Gibraltar . This forced the Abwehr to ask Calvo for new personnel . A Spaniard working on the Rock , Jos Mart n Mu oz , was responsible for the explosion and fire at a large fuel tank at Coaling Island on 30 June 1943 ; this mission , however , would be the first and the last for Mu oz , because he was cornered and arrested by British authorities in August , when he tried to smuggle a bomb into a weapons magazine inside Ragged Staff Cave . After being sentenced to death , he was hanged on 11 January 1944 in Gibraltar by British executioner Albert Pierrepoint . A member of an unrelated Abwehr sabotage network , Luis L pez Cord n - Cuenca also arrested in 1943 was executed by Pierrepoint on the same day . Calvo himself was put under arrest by the Spanish police and neutralized . He would be a free man again in December , when he rejoined the Abwehr in Madrid , under direct orders of Wolfgang Blaum , aka Baumann , head of the sabotage section in Spain . After a Falangist attempt against the life of pro - allied General Jos Enrique Varela , perpetrated by S nchez Rubio network 's agent Juan Jos Dom nguez and a meeting between Anthony Eden and the Spanish ambassador at London , Jacobo Fitz - James Stuart , Abwehr activities around Gibraltar came to an end .
Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere , and is ranked 149th of 182 countries on the Human Development Index . The Australian government 's travel advisory site had previously expressed concerns that Haitian emergency services would be unable to cope in the event of a major disaster , and the country is considered economically vulnerable by the Food and Agriculture Organization . Haiti is no stranger to natural disasters . In addition to earthquakes , it has been struck frequently by tropical cyclones , which have caused flooding and widespread damage . The most recent cyclones to hit the island before the earthquake were Tropical Storm Fay and Hurricanes Gustav , Hanna and Ike , all in the summer of 2008 , causing nearly 800 deaths .
In late 1967 , an acetate of fourteen of Dylan 's compositions was made , from which demos circulated among music groups who might be interested in recording some of the songs . Artists including Peter , Paul and Mary , Manfred Mann and the Byrds eventually did . Dylan 's demo tapes were soon heard by music journalists , including Rolling Stone 's Jann Wenner , who wrote a front - page story in that magazine entitled Dylan 's Basement Tape Should Be Released . This made the general public hungry to hear the music , and in July 1969 a bootleg called Great White Wonder , which included some of the Big Pink songs , came out . Other Basement Tape bootlegs followed .
The first English record of puma was in 1777 , where it had come from the Spanish , who in turn borrowed it from the Peruvian Quechua language in the 16th century , where it means powerful .
Work in Gibraltar began immediately under Commander Geoffrey Birley and his chief engineer Colonel Fordham . The site chosen at Lord Airey 's Battery on the southern tip of the Rock already had an existing tunnelling scheme for a shelter . Extensive trials of the equipment began in January 1942 under the eye of MI6 radio expert Colonel Richard Gambier - Parry . Much thought was also given to the type of men needed for such a strange and demanding task . A member of Scott s ill - fated expedition to the Antarctic , George Murray Levick was called up as Surgeon - Commander to advise on survival techniques . There were practical matters such as diet , exercise , sanitation , and clothing to consider as well as vital psychology of the personnel . The full team was in place by the end of summer 1942 and their cavern fully equipped and ready for occupation . A comprehensive manual was prepared on all aspects of the operation and it was considered that similar secret lookout posts should be prepared throughout the world in the event of future wars . However , Operation Tracer was never needed , as Adolf Hitler turned his attention away from Gibraltar and towards the Eastern Front .
Alkan 's attachment to his Jewish origins is displayed both in his life and his work . He was the first composer to incorporate Jewish melodies in art music . Fluent in Hebrew and Greek , he devoted much time to a complete new translation of the Bible into French . This work , like many of his musical compositions , is now lost . Alkan never married , but his presumed son lie - Miriam Delaborde was , like Alkan , a virtuoso performer on both the piano and the pedal piano , and edited a number of the elder composer 's works .
Every star generates a stellar wind of particles that causes a continual outflow of gas into space . For most stars , the mass lost is negligible . The Sun loses 10 14 M every year , or about 0 . 01 of its total mass over its entire lifespan . However , very massive stars can lose 10 7 to 10 5 M each year , significantly affecting their evolution . Stars that begin with more than 50 M can lose over half their total mass while on the main sequence .

If symptoms develop during the acute phase , they usually resolve spontaneously within three to eight weeks in approximately 90 of individuals . Although the symptoms resolve , even with treatment the infection persists and enters a chronic phase . Of individuals with chronic Chagas disease , 60 80 will never develop symptoms called indeterminate chronic Chagas disease , while the remaining 20 40 will develop life - threatening heart and or digestive disorders during their lifetime called determinate chronic Chagas disease . In 10 of individuals , the disease progresses directly from the acute form to a symptomatic clinical form of chronic Chagas disease .
In 1937 , Sussex beat Somerset at the ground , in a match that once again drew a crowd of around 5 , 000 . The Yorkshire Evening Post described the wicket as crumbling towards the end of the match , favouring the bowlers . In 1938 Hampshire visited , and the report in the Western Daily Press lamented the state of the wicket , which meant that the game , like the three first - class matches at the ground before it , was completed in two days , rather than the scheduled three . That winter , a new pavilion costing 550 was erected on the ground for the shared use of the cricket club and the rugby club . The final first - class match on the ground was played in July 1939 against Lancashire , but torrential rain limited the match to only three hours of play . The takings for the full three days of the match were only 87 , and the Taunton Courier estimated that the losses for the match could be hundreds of pounds . Despite the weather , almost 2 , 000 people attended the match , and the Taunton Courier report praised the alterations that had been made to the ground ; the removal of a hedge made the ground lighter , while the ground itself had been well looked after , and drained quickly . The Second World War suspended the County Championship from 1940 to 1945 , and during that time , Westland Aircraft took over the ground to expand their factory , and informed Yeovil Cricket Club that it was no longer available , forcing them to search for a new ground in 1946 . They eventually relocated to the newly opened Johnson Park in 1948 . The rugby club also moved to Johnson Park , amalgamating itself into Yeovil Sports Club . After a short break , Somerset County Cricket Club returned to Yeovil , playing fourteen fixtures at Johnson Park between 1951 and 1970 , and eight matches at Westlands Sports Ground from 1971 to 1978 .

In November 2008 , the appeal bid was rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in London . QC Simon Bourne , representing Park , had wanted to call an expert witness to challenge geological evidence used at the trial . Lord Justice Keene said that the new evidence did not raise a reasonable doubt as to the safety of this conviction , saying that the geological evidence was only a small element of the strong circumstantial case against the applicant . The new evidence presented by geologist Andrew Moncrief concerned the rock found with the body , said to have been from the wall outside the Parks ' house . Moncrief argued that the rock was indistinguishable from others in the area , and therefore meaningless .
Some algorithms become simpler when used on DAGs instead of general graphs , based on the principle of topological ordering . For example , it is possible to find shortest paths and longest paths from a given starting vertex in DAGs in linear time by processing the vertices in a topological order , and calculating the path length for each vertex to be the minimum or maximum length obtained via any of its incoming edges . In contrast , for arbitrary graphs the shortest path may require slower algorithms such as Dijkstra 's algorithm or the Bellman Ford algorithm , and longest paths in arbitrary graphs are NP - hard to find .

For management and from the visitor 's perspective the forest 's boundaries are its administered area .
Many pictures depict the countryside at Wiedensahl and L thorst . They include pollarded willows , cottages in cornfields , cowherds , autumn landscapes and meadows with streams . A particular feature is the use of red jackets , found in about 280 of 1000 Busch paintings and drawings . The muted or bright red coats are worn usually by a small figure , depicted from behind . The paintings generally represent typical villages . Portraits of the Kesslers , and a series of other portraits depicting Lina Weissenborn in the mid - 1870s , are exceptions . A painting of a 10 - year - old girl from a Jewish family at L thorst portrays her as serious , and having dark , oriental features .

Liszt also wrote piano works based on Robert le diable , notably the R miniscences de Robert le diable subtitled Valse infernale . He also transcribed two pieces from L 'Africaine , as Illustrations de l 'op ra L 'Africaine . Fr d ric Chopin and Auguste Franchomme jointly composed a Grand duo concertant on themes from the opera , for cello and piano , in 1832 , and the Italian pianist and composer Adolfo Fumagalli composed an elaborate fantasy on the opera for left hand alone as his Op. 106 . Other pieces based on the opera included works by Adolf von Henselt and Jean - Am d e M reaux . Similar works , of varying musical quality , were churned out by composers for each of the further operas in attempts to cash in on their success .

Although in places there was a mixture of different companies and platoons dug in together , the Australians were deployed with the 8th Battalion in the south still centred on Bolton 's Ridge . North of them , covering the southern sector of 400 Plateau , were the mixed together 6th and 7th Battalions , both now commanded by Colonel Walter McNicoll of the 6th . North of them was the 5th Battalion , and the 10th Battalion covered the northern sector of 400 Plateau at Johnston 's Jolly . But by now they were battalions in name only , having all taken heavy casualties ; the commanders had little accurate knowledge of where their men were located .

The first England match was held on 9 October 1910 between England and Wales . England ran out winners , 11 6 , beating Wales for the first time since 1898 . The stadium was expanded in 1927 and again in 1932 . Further upgrades did not happen until the 1990s when new North , East and West stands were built . A new South stand was built in 2005 and 2006 to make the stadium into a complete bowl . The first match to be played at the redeveloped Twickenham was on Sunday 5 November 2006 against the All Blacks . England lost the match 41 - 20 in front of a record crowd of 82 , 076 .
While traces of Banai Balai 's association with the folk god Biroba as a mother remain , Banai rarely enjoys independent worship in modern times . She is generally worshipped as Khandoba 's consort . While in Karnataka , her temple is outside the village and Mailara as Khandoba is known in Karnataka journeys every year to visit it for ten nights from his temple in the village . In Maharashtra , Banai 's temple is inside the village , but outside the chief temple , as in Khandoba 's chief temple at Jejuri . Mhalsa - who is installed in the main temple - is said to resist the arrival of Khandoba 's new wife Banai and thus , Banai does not reside in the chief temple . Frustrated by the constant quarrels between the two wives , Khandoba is said to have divided the hill of Jejuri into two halves : the lower half belongs to Banai , where she has a separate shrine while Mhalsa rules the upper half where she stays with Khandoba in the main temple . It is customary to pay respects to Banai on the way up to the main shrine , before worshipping Khandoba and Mhalsa there . It is said that Khandoba bestowed the honour of first worship on Banai , while sending her off to a separate residence .

Fueled by events such as the Waco Siege in 1993 , the murders and suicides associated with the Order of the Solar Temple , and the 1995 Aum Shinrikyo incidents in Japan , German fears and concerns about new religious movements gained in intensity in the 1990s , with Scientology attracting particular attention . Perceptions that Scientology had a totalitarian character were reinforced when Robert Vaughn Young , an American ex - Scientologist and former PR official in the Church of Scientology , visited German officials in late 1995 and wrote an article in Der Spiegel , a widely - read weekly magazine , describing Scientology as a totalitarian system operating a gulag the Rehabilitation Project Force for members of Scientology 's Sea Org found guilty of transgressions . From the mid - 1990s onward , press articles , reports and essays on Scientology appeared on an almost daily basis , accompanied by books and television programmes that reached a mass audience .
On 22 August 1951 , the unions held a mass rally of two million people called Cabildo Abierto . The name Cabildo Abierto was a reference and tribute to the first local Argentine government of the May Revolution , in 1810 . The Per ns addressed the crowd from the balcony of a huge scaffolding set up on the Avenida 9 de Julio , several blocks away from the Casa Rosada , the official government house of Argentina . Overhead were two large portraits of Eva and Juan Per n . It has been claimed that Cabildo Abierto was the largest public display of support in history for a female political figure .
Each level of play has different specifications for the size and shape of the key : in American leagues , where the basketball court is measured in imperial units , the shape is rectangular , while in FIBA - sanctioned events , which use the metric system , the shape was trapezoidal , before being changed to a rectangle as well . In addition to the bounding rectangle , the key includes a free - throw circle at its head or top .

The F d ration Internationale de l 'Automobile FIA was FISA 's parent body , representing car users worldwide . In the same year , Mosley was nominated for a role at the FIA Bureau Internationale de Constructeurs d 'Automobile . His nomination was blocked by French , Italian and German manufacturers .

The Soviet shipbuilding and related industries proved to be incapable of supporting the construction of so many large ships at the same time . The largest warships built in the Soviet Union prior to 1938 were the 8 , 000 - metric - ton 7 , 874 - long - ton Kirov - class cruisers , and even they had suffered from a number of production problems , but the Soviet leadership appeared to ignore the difficulties encountered in the construction of the Kirov class when ordering 14 much more ambitious ships . Construction of two more ships planned for Leningrad and Nikolayev had to move to the brand - new Shipyard Nr. 402 in Molotovsk because the existing shipyards could not be expanded to handle so many large ships . Components for these two ships had to be manufactured at Leningrad and shipped via the White Sea Baltic Canal to Molotovsk . Also , the turret shop at Nikolaev proved to be too poorly equipped to assemble the 406 mm mountings and the propeller shafts had to be ordered in 1940 from Germany and the Netherlands as the domestic plants were already overburdened with orders . Shipbuilding steel proved to be in short supply in 1940 , and a number of batches were rejected because they did not meet specifications . Armor plate production was even more problematic as only 1 , 800 metric tons 1 , 772 long tons of the anticipated 10 , 000 metric tons 9 , 842 long tons were delivered in 1939 , and more than half of that was rejected . Furthermore , the armor plants proved to be incapable of making cemented plates over 230 mm , and inferior face - hardened plates had to substitute for all thicknesses over 200 millimeters 8 in .

Sisler returned to the Tigers for the 1960 season , and manager Dykes noted that he was not confident that his bullpen could help when needed , pointing to the previous season as a reference . The Tigers bullpen had won just nine games in 1959 , but began 1960 with three straight victories , with Sisler pitching a scoreless two - inning appearance on April 22 . His performance was considered a surprise , due to having a poor spring training . Although he pitched well in his first game of the season , he quickly lost his form , and by May 18 , his ERA had risen to 5 . 06 and had a 1 2 record . It was at this point in the season that he began to turn his fortunes around and regained his effectiveness , and by August 12 he had lowered his ERA to 1 . 90 . His season totals included a 2 . 47 ERA and a 7 - 5 win - loss record , both career bests , and added six saves in 80 innings pitched .

The epistemology of anek ntav da and sy dv da also had a profound impact on the development of ancient Indian logic and philosophy . In recent times , Jainism influenced Gandhi , who advocated ahi s and satyagraha .

Aside from being Carey 's second highest worldwide seller , Daydream served as her most personal and directly influenced album at the time . During the album 's recording , Carey grew as an artist , as well as a writer . For the first time in her career , Carey was able to make music that she truly related to , R B and hip hop . While Columbia allowed Carey more leniency with the music she recorded , they became hesitant when she featured Ol ' Dirty in the remix for Fantasy . They feared the sudden change was completely left field for her music , and worried it would jeopardize the album 's success . In an interview with Entertainment Weekly , Carey openly spoke of her issues with Columbia : Everybody was like ' What , are you crazy ? ' They 're nervous about breaking the formula . It works to have me sing a ballad on stage in a long dress with my hair up .

While approaching northern Luzon on October 29 , Krosa quickly intensified as the initial eye feature organized into a well - defined eye . Late on October 30 , the JTWC upgraded Krosa to typhoon status , and the next day , both PAGASA and JMA followed suit . On October 31 , Krosa made landfall in northeastern Luzon near Cagayan , and developed a symmetric eyewall while initially moving over land . Land interaction weakened the eye by the time Krosa emerged into the South China Sea late on October 31 . The next day , PAGASA discontinued advisories after the typhoon exited the region . Convection rebuilt around the center , with continued favorable conditions allowing for restrengthening .
Pliny the Elder 23 79 CE , who refers to the Cedrei and Cedareni Cedarenes in the context of other Arabian tribes , placing their domain to the south of the Conchlei and adjacent to that of the Nabataei , is thought to be referring to the Qedar . Jerome c . 357 420 CE , also writing in Latin , transcribes Qedar as Cedar , and refers to it as a region . In one entry , he describes it as , a region of the Saracens , who are called Ishmaelites in scripture ; in another , he writes that it was a once uninhabitable region across Saracen Arabia ; and in a third , he writes that it is a deserted region of the Ishmaelites , whom they now call Saracens . According to the Catholic Encyclopedia , Theodoret c . 393 c . 457 mentions that in his time , the Qedar lived near Babylon .

In July 2007 , British human rights lawyer David Enright complained to the United Kingdom 's Commission for Racial Equality CRE that he came across the book in the children 's section of Borders bookshop while shopping with his wife and two sons . The CRE called on bookshops to remove the comic , stating that it contained hideous racial prejudice by depicting Congolese who look like monkeys and talk like imbeciles . Responding that it was committed to letting its customers make the choice , Borders moved the book to an area reserved for adult graphic novels . UK bookseller Waterstone 's followed suit . Another British retailer , WHSmith , said that the book was sold on its website , but with a label that recommended it for readers aged 16 and over . The CRE 's attempt to ban the book was criticised by Conservative Party politician Ann Widdecombe , who remarked that the organisation had more important things to do than regulate the availability of historical children 's books . The media controversy increased interest in the book , and Borders reported that its sales of Tintin in the Congo had been boosted 4 , 000 , while it also rose to eighth on the Amazon.com bestseller list . Publisher Egmont UK also responded to racism concerns by placing a protective band around the book with a warning about its content and writing an introduction describing its historical context .

Hoeft , who won 20 games for the Tigers in 1956 , had continually under - performed since , and was noted for being in the manager 's doghouse ; however , TimesDaily sportswriter Hap Halbrooks commented , I can 't see where they Tigers gained a thing in this transaction . The Tigers had lost 15 of their first 17 games of the season before the trade and decided that changes were needed . In addition to the Sisler trade they fired manager Bill Norman and replaced him with Jimmy Dykes . These moves initially proved effective , sparking a winning game streak , which began by defeating the Yankees in both games of a doubleheader on May 3 . Continuing their rebound , the Tigers faced the Red Sox next , winning two of three , and Sisler pitched a scoreless one - inning relief appearance against his former team on May 6 . Used exclusively in relief , Sisler pitched in 32 games for the Tigers , winning one game against three losses and collected seven saves , which was seventh most in the AL , and he did not record an error .
Head VI is an oil - on - canvas painting by the Irish - born English figurative artist Francis Bacon , the last of six panels making up his 1949 Head series . It shows a bust view of a single figure , modeled on Diego Vel zquez 's Portrait of Innocent X. Bacon applies forceful , expressive brush strokes , and places the figure within a glass cage structure , behind curtain - like drapery . This gives the effect of a man trapped and suffocated by his surroundings , screaming into an airless void .
The Missouri 's largest tributaries by runoff are the Yellowstone in Montana and Wyoming , the Platte in Wyoming , Colorado , and Nebraska , and the Kansas Republican Smoky Hill and Osage in Kansas and Missouri . Each of these tributaries drains an area greater than 50 , 000 square miles 130 , 000 km2 , and has an average discharge greater than 5 , 000 cu ft s 140 m3 s . The Yellowstone River has the highest discharge , even though the Platte is longer and drains a larger area . In fact , the Yellowstone 's flow is about 13 , 800 cu ft s 390 m3 s accounting for sixteen percent of total runoff in the Missouri basin and nearly double that of the Platte . On the other end of the scale is the tiny Roe River in Montana , which at 201 feet 61 m long is one the world 's shortest rivers .

Young adults leave their mother to attempt to establish their own territory at around two years of age and sometimes earlier ; males tend to leave sooner . One study has shown high mortality amongst cougars that travel farthest from the maternal range , often due to conflicts with other cougars intraspecific competition . Research in New Mexico has shown that males dispersed significantly farther than females , were more likely to traverse large expanses of non - cougar habitat , and were probably most responsible for nuclear gene flow between habitat patches .

In 1961 Mosley was an election agent for the Union Movement , supporting Walter Hesketh as parliamentary candidate for Moss Side . The motor racing journalist Alan Henry describes him as one of his father 's right - hand men at the time of a violent incident in 1962 , in which Sir Oswald was knocked down by a mob in London and saved from serious injury by his son 's intervention . As a result of his involvement in this fracas , Mosley was arrested and charged with threatening behaviour . He was later cleared at Old Street Magistrates ' Court on the grounds that he was trying to protect his father . By 1964 , when he began work as a barrister , Mosley was no longer involved in politics .
In 1665 , the Concession and Agreement was written in an effort to entice settlers to New Jersey . This document provided for religious freedom , no taxes without assembly approval , and a governor appointed by the proprietors . The first governor appointed in this way was Philip Carteret , who founded Elizabethtown . Colonists were required to pay annual quit - rent taxes . On March 18 , 1674 , after encountering difficulty collecting the taxes , Lord Berkeley sold his share in the colony to Edward Byllynge , a Quaker businessman from London . This sale divided New Jersey into East Jersey and West Jersey ; however , the border between the two was not agreed upon until the Quintipartite Deed in 1676 . From 1701 to 1765 , colonists skirmished in the New York - New Jersey Line War over disputed colonial boundaries .
Having firmly assisted and supported her husband on his path to political greatness , she suddenly died in 1890 , aged 39 , leaving him , distraught and bereft of her support , to achieve the political destiny which she had plotted . His premiership of the United Kingdom was shambolic , and lasted barely a year . For over thirty years following her death , he wandered in a political wilderness , directionless and exceedingly eccentric , until his own death in 1929 .

The main contractor for this project was Laing O 'Rourke Civil Engineering .
A further withdrawal by the 3rd Light Horse Brigade made the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade 's position critical and at 17 : 30 , Chauvel gave orders for a general retirement . Disengagement proved to be a challenge ; it was only the tenacity of the New Zealanders and nightfall which saved them from certain capture . At the last , the Machine Gun Squadron had all its guns in line , some of them firing at a range of 100 yards 91 m ; they were supported by squadrons of the 5th Mounted Brigade , which together , successfully covered the New Zealanders ' withdrawal .

The men 's hammer throw became an Olympic event in 1900 but the women 's event using a 4 kg 8 . 82 lb weight was not widely competed until much later , finally featuring on the women 's Olympic programme in 2000 . The distances thrown by male athletes became greater from the 1950s onwards as a result of improved equipment using the denser metals , a switch to concrete throwing areas , and more advanced training techniques . Professional hammer throwers as historically large , strong , sturdy athletes . However , qualities such as refined technique , speed and flexibility have become increasingly important in the modern era as the legal throwing area has been reduced from 90 to 34 . 92 degrees and throwing technique involves three to four controlled rotations .
The plan of attack was for the British raiding force to sink two obsolete cruisers in the canal mouth at Ostend and three at Zeebrugge , thus preventing raiding ships leaving Bruges . The Ostend canal was the smaller and narrower of the two channels giving access to Bruges and so was considered a secondary target behind the Zeebrugge Raid . Consequently , fewer resources were provided to the force assaulting Ostend . While the attack at Zeebrugge garnered some limited success , the assault on Ostend was a complete failure . The German marines who defended the port had taken careful preparations and drove the British assault ships astray , forcing the abortion of the operation at the final stage .
TV Guide listed Kir 'Shara on its Hot List for the day , while the preview by IGN said that the show finally grows up and becomes a Star Trek series this week . It described Kir 'Shara as far from a perfectly executed Trek story but they get enough right to make it a lot easier to overlook the few things they miss .

It gave Kir 'Shara a rating of four and a half out of five . In Matthew Kappell 's book Star Trek As Myth , he said that he felt that the revelation that the previous Vulcan administration was working with the Romulans all along suddenly makes sense of years of previously incomprehensible Vulcan policy and linked to The Next Generation episode Unification .
South of Heaven was recorded in Los Angeles , California with Reign in Blood producer Rick Rubin . PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand observed that Rubin 's production shoves Dave Lombardo 's drumming right up front in the mix . Guitarist Jeff Hanneman has since said that South of Heaven was the only album the band members discussed before writing the music . Aware that they couldn 't top Reign in Blood , and that whatever they recorded would be compared to that album , he believed they had to slow down , something Slayer had never done on albums before , or since . Guitarist Kerry King cited the need to keep people guessing as another reason for the musical shift . In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on Reign in Blood , Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole , according to Slayer 's official biography . They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned - down vocal styles not heard on previous albums .

Mottola had always been involved in Carey 's career , because he was the head of Sony Music , the parent company of her label . Since the time of Carey 's debut , Mottola had controlled nearly every aspect of her career , keeping her sound carefully regulated and insisting that she continue recording middle - of - the - road pop music , despite her interest in hip hop .
Several terrestrial starlings , including those in the genus Sturnus , have adaptations of the skull and muscles that help with feeding by probing . This adaptation is most strongly developed in the common starling along with the spotless and white - cheeked starlings , where the protractor muscles responsible for opening the jaw are enlarged and the skull is narrow , allowing the eye to be moved forward to peer down the length of the bill . This technique involves inserting the bill into the ground and opening it as a way of searching for hidden food items . Common starlings have the physical traits that enable them to use this feeding technique , which has undoubtedly helped the species spread far and wide .

Her tears fell ere the dews were dried ;
During the early 1870s South Australia 's defence was solely dependent on the volunteer military , and a few artillery pieces purchased during earlier war scares . British troops had been withdrawn from the Australian colonies in 1870 , leaving the state dependent on its own military resources . In a report to the government in 1866 , Colonel Freeling and Major Peter Scratchley recommended establishment of a permanent military force . In 1876 the South Australian government , along with those from New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland requested from the War Office that Major General Sir William Jervois , a noted coastal fortification expert , be appointed to advise on defence needs . He arrived in Sydney in mid - 1877 with then Lieutenant Colonel Scratchley . The 1877 report , delivered after he became South Australian Governor , called for three batteries , at Largs Bay , Semaphore and Glenelg , connected by a military road and supported by field gun emplacements , naval elements and mobile forces . He determined that South Australia 's most probable defence risk was an attack by up to two ships rather than a larger force , and this formed the basis of the final fortification design . His report called for Military Road to be extended to Marino , an electro - contact torpedo station be established on Torrens Island and that a gun boat be provided . In November 1878 the government passed the Military Forces Act , which provided for the raising of a permanent military force and reserve . Two volunteer reserve rifle companies were formed in 1878 and a permanent artillery unit in 1882 .
The company 's traditional preference for the Italian repertoire was partly redressed during the decade : productions include WNO 's first staging of a Richard Strauss opera , Elektra , in 1978 .

The same commentators suggest that here Starr could be referring to the 1969 Paul Is Dead hoax . The latter rumour circulated during September and October of that year while McCartney hid away on his Scottish farm , disconsolate after John Lennon had told him and Starr that he wanted a divorce from the Beatles .
Between 1142 and 1170 the Knights Hospitaller undertook a building programme on the site . The castle was defended by a stone curtain wall studded with square towers which projected slightly . The main entrance was between two towers on the eastern side , and there was a postern gate in the northwest tower . At the center was a courtyard surrounded by vaulted chambers . The lay of the land dictated the castle 's irregular shape . A site with natural defences was a typical location for Crusader castles and steep slopes provided Krak des Chevaliers with defences on all sides bar one , where the castle 's defences were concentrated . This phase of building was incorporated into the later castle 's construction .
The game kicked off at 3 : 00 p.m. EST under sunny skies and in temperatures of 46 F 8 C . Unlike the 1966 Liberty Bowl , in which Virginia Tech scored first , it was Miami who dominated the game 's early going . The Hurricanes scored a touchdown on the first drive of the game and tacked on another touchdown early in the second quarter . Tech was held scoreless in the early going , thanks to two Miami interceptions at the goal line as Virginia Tech was threatening to score . Late in the second quarter , Tech was finally able to get on the scoreboard with a field goal , but at halftime , the Miami Hurricanes led 14 3 . After halftime , the Hokies threatened Miami for the first time all game . Virginia Tech mounted an 80 - yard drive that resulted in a touchdown , cutting Miami 's lead to 14 10 . But the Hurricanes ' defense clamped down on any further offensive attempts by Virginia Tech and denied the Hokies more points . Miami added two field goals : one in the third quarter and one in the fourth quarter that finally put the game out of reach for Virginia Tech . Miami 's win was its first bowl victory since the 1966 Liberty Bowl , which also featured a Hurricane victory over Virginia Tech .

The issue of gangsters in Bintulu was first raised in 2007 by the member of parliament MP for Bintulu . The gangsters may have run businesses related to illegal logging , controlling the prices of diesel , eggs , fertiliser and gas cylinders . Bintulu police have been cracking down on gangster activities in the town . Unscrupulous businessmen who seek cheap labour have caused a rise in the number of illegal immigrants in Bintulu . The number may have reached 50 , 000 in 2009 . Bintulu immigration department has performed several operations to deport illegal immigrants back to their home country .
Little is known of the next two rulers , Ruler 6 is named as K 'inich Tuun Chapat , he celebrated the period ending of 736 and may have died 762 . A damaged text accompanying the image of a bound captive indicates renewed warfare with Palenque during his reign , however the name of the prisoner is lost and it is unclear if it is the actual king of Palenque or merely one of his vassals . He was succeeded by Ruler 7 , about whom even less is known . Around 764 Tonin defeated Palenque in battle .
The Sundial Room , also called the Meridian Hall , was once the residence of Queen Christina of Sweden , then newly converted to Catholicism . The room was further modified by two additions which gave it its current name : a sundial , and a delicate but sophisticated anemoscope which was fixed to the ceiling of the Meridian Hall . These were created by Ignazio Danti , the papal cosmographer , in association with the Gregorian Calendar Reform . The sundial consisted of a straight line in white marble running across the floor in a north - south direction , intended to measure the height of the Sun at noon according to the seasons of the year . The observations made with the sundial provided essential confirmation of the need to reform the Julian calendar . The anemoscope , in contrast , was a complex mechanism attached to the ceiling which was used to measure the strength and direction of the wind but soon stopped functioning . The instrument may have led to the other name of the tower , Tower of the Winds ; however , an ancient observatory at Athens was also called the Tower of the Winds and might have been the source for inspiration .
Another group formed as a result of the events of 5 October was People 's Democracy , a group of students in Queen 's University Belfast . They organised a march from Belfast to Derry in support of civil rights , starting out with about forty young people on 1 January 1969 . The march met with violent opposition from loyalist counter - demonstrators at several points along the route . Finally , at Burntollet Bridge , five miles outside Derry , they were attacked by a mob of about two hundred wielding clubs some of them studded with nails and stones . Half of the attackers were later identified from press photographs as members of the B - Specials . The police , who were at the scene , chatted to the B - Specials as they prepared their ambush , and then failed to protect the marchers , many of whom ran into the river and were pelted with stones from the bank . Dozens of marchers were taken to hospital . The remainder continued on to Derry where they were attacked once more on their way to Craigavon Bridge before they finally reached Guildhall Square , where they held a rally . Rioting broke out after the rally . Police drove rioters into the Bogside , but did not come after them . In the early hours of the following morning , 5 January , members of the RUC charged into St. Columb 's Wells and Lecky Road in the Bogside , breaking windows and beating residents . In his report on the disturbances , Lord Cameron remarked that for such conduct among members of a disciplined and well - led force there can be no acceptable justification or excuse and added that its effect in rousing passions and inspiring hostility towards the police was regrettably great .

Channelization of the lower Missouri waters has made the river narrower , deeper and less accessible to riparian flora and fauna . Numerous dams and bank stabilization projects have been constructed to facilitate the conversion of 300 , 000 acres 1 , 200 km2 of Missouri River floodplain to agricultural land . Channel control has significantly reduced the volume of sediment transported downstream by the river and eliminated critical habitat for fish , birds and amphibians . By the early 21st century , declines in populations of native species prompted the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to issue a biological opinion recommending restoration of river habitats for federally endangered bird and fish species .
On January 29 , 2008 , Jason Lee Miller of WebProNews reported that a Google bomb technique had been used to make the Scientology.org main website the first result in a Google search for dangerous cult . Miller wrote that Anonymous was behind the Google bomb , and that they had also tried to bump Scientology up as the first result in Google searches for brainwashing cult , and to make the Xenu.net website first result in searches for scientology . Rob Garner of MediaPost Publications wrote : The Church of Scientology continues to be the target of a group called Anonymous , which is using Google bombs and YouTube as its tools of choice . 
In its original American broadcast on October 22 , 2009 , Kaboom was seen by 4 . 98 million household viewers , according to Nielsen Media Research . It was a slight increase from the previous week 's episode , Sister City . Kaboom received a 2 . 1 rating 6 share among viewers aged between 18 and 49 . The episode received generally positive reviews . Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said Kaboom was the best episode of the second season , and called Parks and Recreation one of the funniest shows on TV right now . Heisler praised the show for not shying away from outrageousness , and called Andy 's naked entrance by far the highlight of the series . Entertainment Weekly writer Henning Fog said Kaboom continued a trend of superior Parks episodes in season two , and praised the episode for filling in the pit , claiming it both tied up a plot thread that had overstayed its welcome and put to rest any lingering ghosts from the first six episodes . Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode was funny and served as good character development for Leslie and Andy . But Fowler also said some scenes fell flat , and questioned why Ann would continue to harbor feelings for the immature Andy .

FA Cup : 2011 12
On the morning of June 28 , Fort Sullivan was defended by Colonel Moultrie , commanding the 2nd South Carolina Regiment and a company of the 4th South Carolina Artillery , numbering 435 men . At around 9 : 00 am that morning , a British ship fired a signal gun indicating all was ready for the attack . Less than an hour later , nine warships had sailed into positions facing the fort . Thunder and Friendship anchored about 1 . 5 miles 2 . 4 km from the fort while Parker took Active , Bristol , Experiment and Solebay to a closer position about 400 yards 370 m from Sullivan 's Island , where they anchored facing broadside to the fort . Each of these ships began to fire upon the fort when it reached its position , and the defenders returned the fire . Although many of Thunder 's shots landed in or near the fort , they had little effect ; according to Moultrie , We had a morass in the middle , that swallowed them up instantly , and those that fell in the sand in and about the fort , were immediately buried . Thunder 's role in the action was also relatively short - lived ; she had anchored too far away from the fort , and the overloading of her mortars with extra powder to increase their range eventually led to them breaking out of their mounts . Owing to shortage of gunpowder , Moultrie 's men were deliberate in the pace of their gunfire , and only a few officers actually aimed the cannons . They also fired in small volleys , four cannon at a time . One British observer wrote , Their fire was surprisingly well served and it was slow , but decisive indeed ; they were very cool and took care not to fire except their guns were exceedingly well directed . 
Marlborough was placed on the disposal list in May 1932 and was quickly sold to the Alloa Shipbreaking Co . On 25 June , she arrived in Rosyth , where she was broken up for scrap .
As war approached , Walpole realised that his poor eyesight would disqualify him from serving in the armed forces . He volunteered to join the police , but was turned down ; he then accepted a journalistic appointment based in Moscow , reporting for The Saturday Review and The Daily Mail . He was allowed to visit the front in Poland , but his dispatches from Moscow and later from Petrograd , which he preferred were not enough to stop hostile comments at home that he was not doing his bit for the war effort . Henry James was so incensed at one such remark by a prominent London hostess that he stormed out of her house and wrote to Walpole suggesting that he should return to England . Walpole replied in great excitement that he had just been appointed as a Russian officer , in the Sanitar :
The stage structure is different from other games in the series . After the introduction level , the player can only choose between three Robot Masters . Defeating Cold Man unlocks Burner Man and Pirate Man ; defeating Astro Man unlocks Dynamo Man , Tengu Man , and Pirate Man ; and defeating Ground Man unlocks Magic Man and Tengu Man . Clearing one of these unlocked stages opens the way to a security room where the player must destroy a series of crystals with obtained Robot Master weapons . Bypassing all eight crystals opens the way to the fortress stages . In a similar fashion to previous installments in the series , enemies often drop bolts after they are destroyed , and these can be exchanged for various restorative items and upgrades . However , unlike in Mega Man 7 the security cavern offers a way to obtain large amounts of bolts without having to repeatedly visit stages . Some upgrades are unique to either character , such as Mega Man 's ability to call on his dog Rush to search for items , or an adaptor for Bass to combine with his wolf Treble to temporarily fly . Also distributed throughout the introduction and Robot Master levels are a collection of 100 data CDs that contain information on many prominent characters in the series . Most of the CDs are hidden either behind obstacles that need to be destroyed with a special weapon or accessed with a character - specific ability , making it impossible to collect them all on a single playthrough . CDs collected in each playthrough are permanently placed in a database and remain unlocked after beating the game . Saved games are used in place of the series ' traditional password system .
The 1st District 2015 population : 415 , 906 is Manila 's and the country 's most densely populated congressional district . It covers the western portion of Tondo that lies along Manila Bay .
The church featured ample exterior and interior decoration . While the facades were decorated with arches and ceramic tiles , the interior floor mosaics were made of white , yellow and pink marble as well as semi - precious gemstones like sapphire and porphyry . The interior walls were covered with frescoes and mosaics . However , none of the interior decoration has survived . During the church 's 20th - century reconstruction , its interior was repainted by artist Teofan Sokerov , who depicted important moments of medieval Bulgarian history in a modernist style . Due to these murals , the church has never been reconsecrated and remains inactive . The facade of the cathedral also includes a stone with a donor 's inscription of a Bulgarian ruler , which ended up as part of the building material .
Most eukaryotic cell types usually have a single nucleus , but some have no nuclei , while others have several . This can result from normal development , as in the maturation of mammalian red blood cells , or from faulty cell division .
Liquid or solid xenon nanoparticles can be formed at room temperature by implanting Xe ions into a solid matrix . Many solids have lattice constants smaller than solid Xe . This results in compression of the implanted Xe to pressures that may be sufficient for its liquefaction or solidification .
There are a number of methods to determine the TBSA , including the Wallace rule of nines , Lund and Browder chart , and estimations based on a person 's palm size . The rule of nines is easy to remember but only accurate in people over 16 years of age . More accurate estimates can be made using Lund and Browder charts , which take into account the different proportions of body parts in adults and children . The size of a person 's handprint including the palm and fingers is approximately 1 of their TBSA .
Several influential decisions of the House of Lords have determined the limited scope for the use of prerogative powers . In 1915 , an appeal was made to the House of Lords , Re Petition of Right ' Shoreham Aerodrome Case ' , but during the appeal the case was settled and the appeal withdrawn when the Crown agreed to pay compensation . The appeal was from a unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal that the Crown , both under the statutory Defence of the Realm Regulations and by the royal prerogative , was entitled to take and occupy , for military purposes in wartime , a commercial airfield on the south coast . The government argued that this action was to defend against an invasion ; the courts held that for the prerogative to be exercised , the government must demonstrate that a threat of invasion exists . This was backed up by The Zamora 1916 , where the Privy Council , on appeal from the Prize Court , held generally that to exercise a power not granted by statute such as a prerogative power the government must prove to the court that the exercise is justified . The next decision came in Attorney General v De Keyser 's Royal Hotel Ltd 1920 , where the House of Lords confirmed that a statutory provision in an area where prerogative powers are in use abridges the Royal Prerogative while it is in force to this extent that the Crown can only do the particular thing under and in accordance with the statutory provisions , and that its prerogative power to do that thing is in abeyance .
In October the ship was transferred to Freetown to hunt for German commerce raiders in the South Atlantic with Force K. The ship and her half - sisters , Hardy , Hereward , and Hasty , rendezvoused with the battlecruiser Renown , the aircraft carrier Ark Royal , and the light cruiser Neptune on 17 December . They refuelled in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , before proceeding to the estuary of the River Plate in case the damaged German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee attempted to escape from Montevideo , Uruguay , where she had taken refuge after losing the Battle of the River Plate . Hostile was overhauled at Chatham Dockyard between 26 January and 29 March 1940 and then rejoined the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla , now assigned to the Home Fleet . During the First Battle of Narvik on 10 April the ship engaged the German destroyer Z17 Diether von Roeder and badly damaged her , hitting her at least five times . Hostile was only hit once , but the shell did little damage . She escorted her badly damaged sister ship , Hotspur , to the repair base set up at Flakstad ya in the Lofoten Islands . Hostile briefly escorted the battleship HMS Warspite before she returned to Rosyth for repairs between 27 April and 4 May . The ship briefly returned to Norwegian waters , where she again escorted Warspite , before being transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in mid - May .
In Miami , Florida , Furtado collaborated with Pharrell who introduced her to reggaeton and who gave her a shout - out in his 2005 single Can I Have It Like That and Scott Storch with whom she recorded a straight - up rap song before entering the studio with Timbaland . He and his prot g at the time , Danja , co - produced eight of the tracks , with another produced solely by Danja . For some of the beats on the songs , Timbaland finished work on ones already present in the studio that were half - developed or just nucleuses ; the rest were completely reworked . Furtado recorded around forty tracks for Loose , deciding which she would include based on the sonics of the album she called Timbaland a sonic extraterrestrial who came up with a sequence of songs that flowed , and said that the one she had devised was supposedly unsatisfactory . She recorded an unreleased collaboration with Justin Timberlake , Crowd Control , which she described as kind of sexy and a cute , clubby , upbeat , fun track . Other songs considered for inclusion on the album include Chill Boy , Friend of Mine , Go , Hands in the Air , Pretty Boy , Vice and Weak .

Screening of an extract of Hydnellum peckii revealed the presence of an effective anticoagulant , named atromentin 2 , 5 - dihydroxy - 3 , 6 - bis 4 - hydroxyphenyl -1,4 - benzoquinone , and similar in biological activity to the well - known anticoagulant heparin . Atromentin also possesses antibacterial activity , inhibiting the enzyme enoyl - acyl carrier protein reductase essential for the biosynthesis of fatty acids in the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae .
The 40 - metre - long 131 ft 3 in hangar was 20 metres 65 ft 7 in wide forward and 11 metres 36 ft 1 in at the rear . It was 6 metres 19 ft 8 in high and designed to stow nine aircraft . It was fitted with fire fighting foam and carbon dioxide dispensers as a result of wartime experience . The ' T ' -shaped lift was 12 . 1 metres 39 ft 8 in wide at its forward end and 6 . 6 metres 21 ft 8 in wide at the its aft end . It was 12 . 1 metres long and had a capacity of 6 tonnes 5 . 9 long tons . Petrol storage tanks with a capacity of 76 tonnes 75 long tons were installed in the former magazine of Turret No. 6 to provide each aircraft with enough fuel for three sorties . To recover the aircraft the collapsible crane formerly on the stern was moved up to the port side of the flight deck . Another crane was intended on the starboard side , but it was never fitted .
The substance of the Agreement formally referred to as the Belfast Agreement was later endorsed by referendums in both parts of Ireland . The Agreement restored self - government to Northern Ireland on the basis of power - sharing in a regional Executive drawn from the major parties in a new Northern Ireland Assembly , with entrenched protections for the two main communities . The Executive is jointly headed by a First Minister and deputy First Minister drawn from the unionist and nationalist parties . Violence had decreased greatly after the Provisional IRA and loyalist ceasefires in 1994 and in 2005 the Provisional IRA announced the end of its armed campaign and an independent commission supervised its disarmament and that of other nationalist and unionist paramilitary organisations .

Passing along the face of the eastern hill to the north of Sitabai 's cave is a small Hindu excavation with a veranda , which was probably to be three cells , but was abandoned following the discovery of a flaw in the rock . Towards the east of hill is a dry pond , with large artificial boulders and Buddhist cisterns along its banks . At the end of the north spur of the main hill is a mound that resembles a Buddhist stupa .

The Bath stone building has rooms arranged in a U shape . There are four main function rooms in the complex : the 100 - foot - long 30 m ballroom the largest Georgian interior in Bath ; the tea room ; the card room ; and the octagon . The rooms have Whitefriars crystal chandeliers and are decorated with fine art . In the 20th century they were used as a cinema and in 1931 were taken over by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings and restored . They were bombed and burnt out during the Second World War , with restoration undertaken by Sir Albert Richardson before reopening in 1963 . They are now owned by the National Trust and operated by Bath and North East Somerset Council for public functions . The basement of the building provides a home to the Fashion Museum .
The Natives next defeated both Northamptonshire and Kent , before defeats by Moseley and Burton - on - Trent . Both defeats were unexpected , and in the Moseley match , injuries played a part the tourists played most of the match at least two men down , as replacements were then not allowed . The team recovered to win their next game , against Midlands Counties in Birmingham . Their next fixture was against Middlesex in a match not open to the public , and hosted by the Earl of Sheffield at Sheffield Park , Uckfield . The Middlesex side contained a number of international players , including Arthur Gould . Middlesex won easily , with the Natives play characterised by poor tackling . The final score was 9 0 , with three tries conceded by the New Zealanders . Prior to the match both sides had enjoyed lunch with wine an indulgence the Natives were not used to . A report in the Auckland Star had this to say of the game :
Villaret in Montagne , having successfully broken contact with the British flagship and slipped away to the north , managed to gather 11 ships of the line around him and formed them up in a reconstituted battle squadron . At 11 : 30 , with the main action drawing to a close , he began a recovery manoeuvre intended to lessen the tactical defeat his fleet had suffered . Aiming his new squadron at the battered Queen , Villaret 's attack created consternation in the British fleet , which was unprepared for a second engagement . However , discerning Villaret 's intention , Howe also pulled his ships together to create a new force . His reformed squadron consisted of Queen Charlotte , Royal Sovereign , Valiant , Leviathan , Barfleur , and Thunderer . Howe deployed this squadron in defence of Queen , and the two short lines engaged one another at a distance before Villaret abandoned his manoeuvre and hauled off to collect several of his own dismasted ships that were endeavouring to escape British pursuit . Villaret was subsequently joined by the battered Terrible , which sailed straight through the dispersed British fleet to reach the French lines , and he also recovered the dismasted Scipion , Mucius , Jemmappes , and R publicain all of which lay within reach of the unengaged British ships before turning eastwards towards France . At this stage of the battle , Howe retired below and the British consolidation was left to his Captain of the Fleet , Sir Roger Curtis . Curtis was subsequently blamed by some in the Navy for not capturing more of the dismasted French ships , and was also accused of dissuading Howe from attempting further pursuit .
Apart from stimulating the development of urban areas , temples and religious buildings featured a number of unique aesthetic and structural features . The Temple of the Saintly Mother and the Hall of Sacrifice of the Jin Temple , located in a southeastern suburb of Taiyuan City , Shanxi province , are extant examples of early Song architecture . The Temple of the Saintly Mother is the main building of the Jin Temple , first built in the period between 1023 and 1032 and renovated in 1102 . It has a double - eaved roof with nine ridges , and two dragon - heads with wide - open jaws biting the ends of the main ridge . The roof is supported by massive dougong brackets corresponding to drawings in Yingzao Fashi . The eaves of the Temple of the Saintly Mother curve upward slightly at each end , a characteristic of Song architecture . The columns of the fa ade , decorated with dragons that coil around the shafts , become progressively taller with increasing distance to either side of the central pair . The building has a porch around it , the sole example of such a structure ; another unique feature of the site is a cross - shaped bridge that leads to the Goddess Temple .
The first horses were introduced to New Zealand by Protestant missionary Reverend Samuel Marsden in December 1814 , and wild horses were first reported in the Kaimanawa Range in central North Island of New Zealand in 1876 . The Kaimanawa breed descended from domestic horses that were released in the late 19th century and early 20th century in the middle of the North Island around the Kaimanawa mountains . Between 1858 and 1875 , Major George Gwavas Carlyon imported Exmoor ponies to Hawkes Bay and crossed them with local stock to produce the Carlyon pony . These Carlyon ponies were later crossed with two Welsh stallions , Kinarth Caesar and Comet , imported by Sir Donald McLean , and a breed known as the Comet resulted . At some point during the 1870s , McLean released a Comet stallion and several mares on the Kaingaroa Plains and the bloodline apparently became part of the wild Kaimanawa population . Other horses were added to the bloodline through escapes and releases from local sheep stations and from cavalry units at Waiouru that were threatened with a strangles epidemic . It is also thought that in the 1960s Nicholas Koreneff released an Arabian stallion into the Argo Valley region .
Critics such as Malcolm Cowley and Delmore Schwartz describe mixed emotions about the religiosity of the poem . Cowley emphasised the mystical nature of the poem and how its themes were closer to Buddhism than Anglicanism while mentioning his appreciation of many of the passages . Schwartz also mentioned the Buddhist images and his admiration for many of the lines in Little Gidding . F. B. Pinion believed that the fourth section of the poem costs Eliot more trouble and vexation than any passage of the same length he ever wrote , and is his greatest achievement in the Four Quartets . E. M. Forster did not like Eliot 's emphasis on pain and responded to the poem : Of course there 's pain on and off through each individual 's life ... You can 't shirk it and so on . But why should it be endorsed by the schoolmaster and sanctified by the priest until the fire and the rose are one when so much of it is caused by disease and bullies ? It is here that Eliot becomes unsatisfactory as a seer . Writing in 2003 , Roger Scruton wrote that in Little Gidding Eliot achieved that for which he envies Dante namely , a poetry of belief , in which belief and words are one , and in which the thought cannot be prized free from the controlled and beautiful language .

His father , Hall of Famer George Sisler ; and one of his brothers , Dick Sisler , also played baseball at the major league level ; while another brother , George Sisler , Jr . , was a general manager for several minor league baseball teams , and later became president of the International League from 1966 to 1976 .
Dover Athletic 's highest finish in the English football league system was in the 1999 2000 season , in which the team finished in sixth place in the Football Conference , the highest level of non - league football and the fifth level overall . The Whites have made 13 appearances in the final qualifying round of the FA Cup , but have only progressed to the first round proper three times . In the 2010 11 season , Dover reached the third round for the first time , defeating Football League Two teams Gillingham and Aldershot Town in the first two rounds before losing to Huddersfield Town of Football League One . In the 1997 98 season the Whites reached the semi - finals of the FA Trophy but missed out on an appearance at Wembley , losing to Cheltenham Town . The largest number of points the team has accrued is 102 in the 1989 90 season , and the highest total number of goals scored in a season is 89 , scored in 40 matches in the 1985 86 season . The team 's biggest ever win was an 8 0 defeat of East Preston in September 2009 , and the heaviest defeat was a 7 1 loss to Poole Town in April 1984 .

In the autumn of 744 , he met Li Bai Li Po for the first time , and the two poets formed a friendship . David Young describes this as the most significant formative element in Du Fu 's artistic development because it gave him a living example of the reclusive poet - scholar life to which he was attracted after his failure in the civil service exam . The relationship was somewhat one - sided , however . Du Fu was by some years the younger , while Li Bai was already a poetic star . We have twelve poems to or about Li Bai from the younger poet , but only one in the other direction . They met again only once , in 745 .
The German military was the first to promote condom use among its soldiers , beginning in the later 19th century . Early 20th century experiments by the American military concluded that providing condoms to soldiers significantly lowered rates of sexually transmitted diseases . During World War I , the United States and at the beginning of the war only Britain were the only countries with soldiers in Europe who did not provide condoms and promote their use .

Particularly early in the season , Hamels was plagued by a lack of run support ; as of May 27 , he had the fifth - lowest in the major leagues . He lost his eighth start on May 27 , declining to a record of 1 8 , which one Sports Illustrated column attributed more to the Phillies poor offense than Hamels . Nevertheless , it was easily ... Hamels worst performance of his eight - year career . Aside from offensive struggles while Hamels was pitching , the Phillies defense struggled , though Hamels kept a positive attitude , once commenting that his luck should improve , as I 've been doing pretty well on the plane in poker . Towards the end of the season , however , Hamels put it together ; in his final 11 starts. he surrendered more than three runs only once . In total , he amassed an 8 14 record with a 3 . 60 ERA in 220 innings and 202 strikeouts sixth in NL . Despite struggles from his teammates , Bill Baer noted that Hamels ,

In March 2015 , Vistara shifted to its new office at the One Horizon Center tower in Sector 43 , Gurgaon , a satellite city of Delhi . Vistara chose Phee Teik Yeoh as the chief executive officer CEO and Giam Ming Toh as the chief commercial officer CCO , both with Singapore Airlines background . Initially it started out with a three - member board comprising Swee Wah Mak SIA group , Mukund Rajan and Prasad Menon Tata group , with the latter as chairman . In August 2015 , the airline expanded the board by introducing two new members , Som Mittal and Sangeeta Pendurkar , along with an equity infusion of 2 billion US 30 million , part of 5 billion US 74 million initially planned by Tata and SIA together . In January 2016 , Bhaskar Bhat , former Managing Director of Titan , joined as the new chairman following Prasad Menon 's retirement . In March 2016 , Vistara appointed Sanjiv Kapoor as its chief strategy and commercial officer as the successor to Giam Ming Toh who was scheduled to leave in mid April 2016 following completion of his deputation at Vistara .
Resuming their advance , the Australians were supported by three squadrons of Corsairs from the Royal New Zealand Air Force Nos. 14 , 22 and 26 Squadrons which bombed and strafed the ground in front of the advancing infantry , as well as a creeping barrage of artillery and mortar fire . With such strong support the Japanese offered little resistance and over the course of two days the 24th Infantry Battalion covered almost a third of the distance to the Hongorai , for just one man wounded . Further progress was made over the next week , but on 4 May the advance was slowed when they encountered a roadblock defended by a field gun along with a machine gun , mines and other improvised explosive devices . After this , the 15th Brigade 's engineer support were called upon to regularly carry out route clearance and proving operations as the Japanese became increasingly desperate to destroy the Australian armour , to the extent that they were prepared to sacrifice an artillery piece in order to lure the Australian tanks into a trap where they could be destroyed by mines . The Japanese began to adapt their tactics in other ways also . To negate the effectiveness of the Australian tanks , the Japanese began to position themselves off the roads , forcing the infantry to fight without their armoured support . Additionally , the Japanese began to concentrate their artillery with increasing accuracy upon the advancing infantry , which they kept under constant observation and fire .

In the BBC series Yes Minister Yes Prime Minister , the Minister Jim Hacker 's local team was Aston Villa , as was the Member of Parliament for Birmingham East .
The rails are a bird family comprising nearly 150 species . Although origins of the group are lost in antiquity , the largest number of species and least specialised forms are found in the Old World , suggesting this family originated there . The taxonomy of the small crakes is complicated , but the closest relative of the corn crake is the African crake , C. egregia , which has sometimes been given its own genus , Crecopsis , but is now more usually placed in Crex . Both species are short - billed brown birds with a preference for grassland rather than wetland habitats typical of rails . Porzana crakes , particularly the ash - throated crake Porzana albicollis are near relatives of the Crex genus .
In October 2004 , Dylan published the first part of his autobiography , Chronicles : Volume One . Confounding expectations , Dylan devoted three chapters to his first year in New York City in 1961 1962 , virtually ignoring the mid - 1960s when his fame was at its height . He also devoted chapters to the albums New Morning 1970 and Oh Mercy 1989 . The book reached number two on The New York Times ' Hardcover Non - Fiction best seller list in December 2004 and was nominated for a National Book Award .
He realized that his position was no longer tenable without the support of an heir who had the approval of both the army and the people . Shortly thereafter , he announced the adoption of Trajan as his successor , and with this decision all but abdicated . Trajan was formally bestowed with the title of Caesar and shared the consulship with Nerva in 98 :
Construction of a 5 . 4 - mile 8 . 7 km long section of Route 4 from what is now exit 6 in East Greenwich to I - 95 in Warwick began in 1967 and was completed in 1972 . That year , the 3 - mile 4 . 8 km arterial south of the modern exit 5 was also designated as part of Route 4 . The divided highway remains largely intact to this date as the stretch of Route 4 from US 1 to Routes 2 and 102 at exit 5 ; the only piece of the arterial that has been significantly altered is the construction of a bridge over Amtrak 's Northeast Corridor line . By the early 1970s , Route 4 was complete north of exit 6 and south of what would become exit 5 , but there was a still a missing piece in the highway between the two exits . In the 1970s , the state of Rhode Island faced several budget problems and environmental concerns , both of which delayed the construction of the missing link for nearly eleven years . Environmental studies on the missing link began in 1977 , and the state estimated that the 1 . 5 - mile 2 . 4 km long section of freeway would cost 15 21 million equivalent to 59 82 million in 2016 to construct .
As the chief parliamentary spokesman for an abandoned policy , Calvert no longer served a useful purpose to the English Royal Court , and by February 1624 his duties had been restricted to placating the Spanish ambassador . The degree of his disfavour was shown when he was reprimanded for supposedly delaying diplomatic letters . Calvert bowed to the inevitable . On the pretext of ill health , he began negotiations for the sale of his position , finally resigning the secretariat in February 1625 .

 The rate of supporting fire had evidently been felt , and the Commandos in the area of the Tirpitz dock had undoubtedly overcome the resistance in that area . There was an appreciable slackening in the enemy 's fire . 
In providing instrumentation for the record , Kurstin used all of his instruments such as a Mellotron and a Chamberlin , taping them from a distance to stimulate the Wall of Sound , a recording technique originally developed by Phil Spector that was popular in the early 1960s . He enlisted Clarkson to provide all the background vocals herself . Clarkson , who grew up singing in a chorus , was pleased with the aspect ; saying , Blending is something I knew how to do from childhood . Sometimes I 'd have to do an alto instead of a soprano because they needed a bigger sound . But I 've never had to do anything like this before doing all my backup vocals , essentially being my own choir . Together , they began to record in May 2013 and continued through the summer of that year , beginning by recording White Christmas with Clarkson in the vocal booth and with Kurstin on a piano . She commented , The production is all him . I would be just like ' Hey , can we make this more jazz ? Hey , can we make this more bluesy . And he just , like Harry Potter , made this happen . It 's so weird . 
Early nutritional scientists such as the German Carl von Voit believed that protein was the most important nutrient for maintaining the structure of the body , because it was generally believed that flesh makes flesh . Karl Heinrich Ritthausen extended known protein forms with the identification of glutamic acid . At the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station a detailed review of the vegetable proteins was compiled by Thomas Burr Osborne . Working with Lafayette Mendel and applying Liebig 's law of the minimum in feeding laboratory rats , the nutritionally essential amino acids were established . The work was continued and communicated by William Cumming Rose . The understanding of proteins as polypeptides came through the work of Franz Hofmeister and Hermann Emil Fischer . The central role of proteins as enzymes in living organisms was not fully appreciated until 1926 , when James B. Sumner showed that the enzyme urease was in fact a protein .
 We had the song pitched to us and originally it wasn t a duet . The more I was listening to the thing and learning the song , I realized it set itself up to be a duet if we wanted to go that route . When I called my producer about it he asked who I wanted to sing it with me and I said Kelly Clarkson , but I didn t think we d be able to get her . I ve always been a big fan of hers . I love her voice and I love her style . Long story short , we got her a copy of the song and she loved it . As soon as she started singing , it became obvious it was going to be great . 
At 03 : 00 , 1 September , the 9th Infantry Regiment ordered its only reserve , E Company to move west along the Yongsan - Naktong River road and take a blocking position at the pass between Cloverleaf Hill and Obong - ni Ridge , 3 miles 4 . 8 km from the river and 6 miles 9 . 7 km from Yongsan . This was the critical terrain where so much heavy fighting had taken place in the first battle of the Naktong Bulge . Fighting began at the pass at 02 : 30 when an American medium tank of A Company , 72nd Tank Battalion , knocked out a T - 34 at Tugok , also called Morisil . E Company never reached its blocking position . A strong North Korean force surprised and delivered heavy automatic fire on it at 03 : 30 from positions astride the road east of the pass . The company suffered heavy casualties , including the company commander and Keiser 's aide who had accompanied the force . With the critical parts of Cloverleaf Hill and Obong - ni Ridge , the best defensive terrain between Yongsan and the river , the North Koreans controlled the high ground . The US 2nd Infantry Division now had to base its defense of Yongsan on relatively poor defensive terrain , the low hills at the western edge of the town .

Nathan spent all of 2003 with the Giants in the bullpen after marrying Lisa Lemoncelli , his girlfriend of five years , in November 2002 . This was a breakout year for Nathan , starting the season with 23 scoreless innings en route to a 12 4 record in his first full year as a reliever . His 78 appearances put him high on the list of most - used pitchers for the season as one of the best setup men in the NL , allowing no runs in 15 appearances from July 18 to August 20 . His 12 wins in relief led the majors . The Giants won the National League West by 151 2 games and drew the Florida Marlins , the National League 's wild card winner , in the NLDS . Nathan was hit hard in that series , blowing his only save opportunity . His team fared no better , winning Game 1 behind Jason Schmidt 's complete game shutout before dropping the next three .
Although Hardy states that the Kaurna people did not live in the ranges themselves , they did live on the lower slopes . An early settler of the neighbouring suburb of Beaumont , James Milne Young , described the local Kaurnas : At every creek and gully you would see their wurlies simple Aboriginal homes made out of twigs and grass and their fires at night ... often as many as 500 to 600 would be camped in various places ... some behind the Botanic Gardens on the banks of the river ; some toward the Ranges ; some on the Waterfall Gully . Their main presence , demarcated by the use of fire against purchasers of land , was on the River Torrens and the creeks that flowed into it , including Waterfall Gully 's First Creek .
Some of the stories in The One I Love contain autobiographical elements . Different and Cute draw on Ohkawa 's personal experiences , while Together draws on Mokona 's . Additionally , Suddenly is based on her admiration of manga artist Hagiwara Kuzushi 's dedication to his fans . Normal , Apart , and Insecure were inspired by Ohkawa 's conversations with friends , and I Miss You has its origins in a conversation with manga artist Okazaki Takeshi , who rarely saw his girlfriend because of his work . A Younger Man stems from Ohkawa 's conversation with actor Tonesaku Toshihide and his thoughts on men and age in a relationship . In contrast , Courage appeared as a Valentine 's Day story in the February issue of Young Rose ; Clamp rarely had opportunities to create seasonal stories , as the magazine that typically serialized their work did not run seasonal stories .
Maximilian Hell published the results of his expedition in 1770 , in Copenhagen . Based on the results of his own expedition , and of Wales and Cook , in 1772 he presented another calculation of the astronomical unit : 151 . 7 million kilometers . Lalande queried the accuracy and authenticity of the Hell expedition , but later he retreated in an article of Journal des s avans , in 1778 .
A manuscript addition to a copy of Mother Goose 's Melody published in 1803 has the modern version with a different last line : Could not set Humpty Dumpty up again . It was published in 1810 in a version of Gammer Gurton 's Garland as :

 tsuki Fumihiko in Daigenkai 1932 1935 proposes that the word comes from kitsu , which is onomatopoeia for the bark of a fox , and ne , which may be an affix or an honorific word meaning a servant of an Inari shrine .
Astraeus hygrometricus is an ectomycorrhizal fungus and grows in association with a broad range of tree species . The mutualistic association between tree roots and the mycelium of the fungus helps the trees extract nutrients particularly phosphorus from the earth ; in exchange , the fungus receives carbohydrates from photosynthesis . In North America , associations with oak and pine are usual , while in India , it has been noted to grow commonly with chir pine Pinus roxburghii and sal Shorea robusta . The false earthstar is found on the ground in open fields , often scattered or in groups , especially in nutrient - poor , sandy or loamy soils . It has also been reported to grow on rocks , preferring acid substrates like slate and granite , while avoiding substrates rich in lime . In Nepal , fruit bodies have been collected at elevations of 3 , 000 m 9 , 800 ft . Fruit bodies typically appear in autumn , although the dry fruit bodies are persistent and may last up to several years . Gelatinipulvinella astraeicola is a leotiaceous fungus with minute , gelatinous , pulvinate cushion - shaped apothecia , known to grow only on the inner surface of the rays of dead Astraeus species , including A. hygrometricus .
After a redshirt season in 2005 , Turner saw no playing time as the third - string quarterback the following year . In 2007 , he replaced the injured starter during the game against 10th - ranked Rutgers and led the Terrapins to an upset victory . After that , he remained as the team 's leader for the remainder of the season , and against eighth - ranked Boston College , engineered another upset victory . Turner also helped Maryland secure an appearance in the Emerald Bowl . At the start of the 2008 season , he was relegated to backup status , but soon regained the starting position . That year , he led Maryland in wins over four of their five ranked opponents and to an appearance in the Humanitarian Bowl . He returned as the starter for the 2009 season , but suffered a knee injury and was replaced by Jamarr Robinson .
Stevens ' teams are built around solid basketball fundamentals and good team work , rather than individual basketball skill . His teams are known for their defense , forcing opponents into uncharacteristic mistakes . The secret to basketball and life is just to do the job to the best of your ability and don 't worry about anything else , Stevens says . Win the next game . Win the next possession . That 's our focus . It 's boring . It 's also the way championships are won , he says . In short , Stevens is a strong believer in The Butler Way doing all the little things that transform a group of good basketball players into a great basketball team . I tell the players ' the Butler Way ' isn 't easy to define , Stevens says , but you can see it on the floor when we share the basketball , play with great energy and defend .

Families of 45 of the 47 passengers sued Comair for negligence . Families of the other two victims settled with the airline before filing litigation . Three sample cases were due to be heard on August 4 , 2008 ; but the trial was indefinitely postponed after Comair reached a settlement with the majority of the families . Cases brought by Comair against the airport authority and the FAA , arguing each should share in the compensation payments , are now resolved . The case against the airport authority was dismissed on sovereign immunity grounds , and this ruling was upheld by the Kentucky Supreme Court on October 1 , 2009 . In Comair 's case against the United States , a settlement was reached with the United States agreeing to pay 22 of the liability for the crash , while Comair agreed to pay the remaining 78 .

Andrew was promoted to sergeant the day after his VC - winning action . He continued to serve on the front until early 1918 , when he was sent to England for officer training . He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in March 1918 , but remained in England until the end of the war .
Since her debut in 1990 , Carey had not journeyed on a large or extensive tour . In fact , she had not embarked on a tour until her third studio effort , Music Box 1993 , when she performed six arena shows in the United States during the Music Box Tour . The opening night of the tour received scathing reviews , mostly aimed at Carey 's deemed obvious stage - fright and failure to make a connection with the crowd . Succeeding nights were more favorably reviewed , with critics raving about Carey 's vocals . Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote regarding Carey 's live vocals , Beyond any doubt , Ms. Carey 's voice is no studio concoction . Her range extends from a rich , husky alto to dog - whistle high notes ; she can linger over sensual turns , growl with playful confidence , syncopate like a scat singer . However , after the strong media attention , Carey did not visit the US on her succeeding Daydream World Tour in 1996 , visiting only Europe and Asia . The tour in contrast , received critical acclaim from critics and fans alike , as well as breaking ticket sale records . Carey 's three shows at Japan 's largest stadium , Tokyo Dome , sold out in under three hours , equaling in over 150 , 000 tickets , setting the record of fastest show sellouts in Japan 's history . On the Butterfly World Tour , Carey broke the record , selling 200 , 000 tickets in under one hour . During 1997 , after the commercially and critically successful release of Butterfly , Carey had not planned to tour once again , due to the long travel times and strain on her voice . However , due to overwhelming demand by fans , Carey agreed to perform in Asia once again , only extending the tour to Taiwan and Australia , as well as one last show in the United States . Rehearsals for the show began shortly after Christmas 1997 , extending for a period of two weeks .
The new United States Navy Zumwalt - class guided missile destroyer has been described as bearing resemblance to ironclads .
Meanwhile , native island scouts directed by British government official and officer in the British Solomon Islands Protectorate Defence Force , Martin Clemens told the Marines of Japanese troops at Taivu , near the village of Tasimboko , about 17 mi 27 km east of Lunga . Edson launched a raid against the Japanese troops at Taivu . Destroyer transports USS McKean and Manley and two patrol boats took 813 of Edson 's men to Taivu in two trips . Edson and his first wave of 501 troops landed at Taivu at 05 : 20 local time on 8 September . Supported by aircraft from Henderson Field and gunfire from the destroyer transports , Edson 's men advanced towards Tasimboko village but were slowed by Japanese resistance . At 11 : 00 , the rest of Edson 's men landed . With this reinforcement and more support from the Henderson Field aircraft , Edson 's force pushed into the village . The Japanese defenders , believing a major landing was underway after observing the concurrent approach of an Allied supply ship convoy heading towards Lunga Point , retreated into the jungle , leaving behind 27 dead . Two Marines were killed .

Based on how sensitive monkeys were to the venom , Whaler 1971 estimated 14 mg of venom would be enough to kill a human being : equivalent to 0 . 06 ml of venom , or 1 50 to 1 1000 of what can be obtained in a single milking . Marsh and Whaler 1984 wrote that 35 mg 1 30 of the average venom yield would be enough to kill a man of 70 kilograms 150 lb . Branch 1992 suggested that 90 100 mg would be fatal in humans . Due to the rarity of these type of snakebites , further investigation is needed .
Other groups , on both the unionist side and the nationalist side , participated in violence and a period known as the Troubles began . Over 3 , 600 deaths resulted over the subsequent three decades of conflict . Owing to the civil unrest during the Troubles , the British government suspended home rule in 1972 and imposed direct rule . There were several unsuccessful attempts to end the Troubles politically , such as the Sunningdale Agreement of 1973 . In 1998 , following a ceasefire by the Provisional IRA and multi - party talks , the Good Friday Agreement was concluded as a treaty between the British and Irish governments , annexing the text agreed in the multi - party talks .
Steel was also an obvious material for armor . It was tested in the 1860s , but the steel of the time was too brittle and disintegrated when struck by shells . Steel became practical to use when a way was found to fuse steel onto wrought iron plates , giving a form of compound armor . This compound armor was used by the British in ships built from the late 1870s , first for turret armor starting with HMS Inflexible and then for all armor starting with HMS Colossus of 1882 . The French and German navies adopted the innovation almost immediately , with licenses being given for the use of the ' Wilson System ' of producing fused armor .
On February 2 , 2008 , 150 people gathered outside a Church of Scientology center in Orlando , Florida to protest the organization 's practices . Small protests were also held in Santa Barbara , California during the Santa Barbara International Film Festival , and Manchester , England . Protesters in Orlando carried signs with messages Knowledge is Free and Honk if you hate Scientology . According to WKMG - TV , the protesters called the Church of Scientology a dangerous cult and said the organization is responsible for crimes and deaths . The Orlando Sentinel reported that the protest was part of a worldwide campaign by a group that calls itself Anonymous , and an unnamed organizer who spoke to the paper stated that the group was protesting a gross violation of the right to see free church material , referring to the Tom Cruise video that was pulled from YouTube .
The judge also read a sworn statement from Abaton 's former producer , who stated that she had not known about the incident . She was aware that an ambulance was called that evening , but learned about the reasons for that only later , during the police investigation . The court further heard that Lamb of God had sent a list of security demands to the concert venue , including that barriers should be placed 1 . 5 metres 4 . 9 ft from the stage . Promoter Tom Fiala testified that although this was not the case , the band had not expressed any concerns to him either before or after the concert .
The episode title is a reference to the standard of the Roman legion , a symbol that represents the legion 's unity . While the storyline detailing its theft was based on fiction , Heller believed that it showed how Caesar could turn misfortune into opportunity . He was always one step ahead of his enemies . Certain characters were changed from their traditional images ; for instance , while Brutus has been portrayed as the noblest Roman , Heller and historical consultant Jonathan Stamp thought it would be interesting to have him forced into his later role through his ancestry . Alluding to the fact that Brutus ' great great great grandfather drove the last king out of Rome , Stamp said that his family history was pushing him in one direction , his emotions in another . 
The Chapel of Saint Eligius Spanish : Capilla de San Eligio , also known as the Chapel of the Lord of Safe Expeditions Spanish : Capilla del Se or del Buen Despacho , was built by the first silversmith guild , who donated the images of the Conception and Saint Eligius to whom the chapel was formerly dedicated . The chapel was redecorated in the 19th century , and the image of Our Lord of Good Sending was placed here , named thus , since many supplicants reported having their prayers answered quickly . The image is thought to be from the 16th century and sent as a gift from Charles V of Spain .
 Third tour in Iraq 
During the early years of the 1880s , an Egyptian regime in the Sudan , backed by the British , came under threat from rebellion under the leadership of native Muhammad Ahmad or Ahmed , known as Mahdi to his followers . In 1883 , as part of the Mahdist War , the Egyptians sent an army to deal with the revolt , but they were defeated and faced a difficult campaign of extracting their forces . The British instructed the Egyptians to abandon the Sudan , and sent General Charles Gordon to co - ordinate the evacuation , but he was killed in January 1885 . When news of his death arrived in New South Wales in February 1885 , the government offered to send forces and meet the contingent 's expenses . The New South Wales Contingent consisted of an infantry battalion of 522 men and 24 officers , and an artillery battery of 212 men and sailed from Sydney on 3 March 1885 .

In June 1994 , the United Keetoowah Band had voted to stop awarding associate memberships . Such honorary associate membership recognizes an individual 's assistance to the tribe , but it has nothing to do with Indian ancestry , and it does not entitle an individual to vote in the tribe as a member . The Keetoowah Band states that Churchill still holds the associate membership and it has not been rescinded . In a separate interview , Ernestine Berry , formerly on the tribe 's enrollment committee and four years on its council , said that Churchill had never fulfilled a promise to help the tribe .
Both types of heavy guns used where the only ones of their specific series and type to come to Australia . Though they were never fired in anger , the battery is only 40 feet 12 m above mean sea level which would have limited the accuracy of the mark III depression rangefinders used .
To insulate the sacred power in the sanctuary from the impurities of the outside world , the Egyptians enclosed temple sanctuaries and greatly restricted access to them . People other than kings and high priests were thus denied contact with cult statues . The only exception was during festival processions , when the statue was carried out of the temple but still enclosed in a portable shrine . People did have less direct means of interaction . The more public parts of temples often incorporated small places for prayer , from doorways to freestanding chapels near the back of the temple building . Communities also built and managed small chapels for their own use , and some families had shrines inside their homes . Despite the gulf that separated humanity from the divine , the Egyptians were surrounded by opportunities to approach their gods .
The island is composed of a variety of volcanic and sedimentary rock formations from the Devonian period . At that time the Scottish landmass formed part of the Old Red Sandstone Continent and lay some 10 - 25 degrees south of the equator . The accumulations of Old Red Sandstone , laid down from 408 to 370 million years ago , were created as earlier Silurian rocks , uplifted by the formation of Pangaea , eroded and then were deposited into river deltas . The freshwater Lake Orcadie existed on the edges of the eroding mountains , stretching from Shetland to the southern Moray Firth . The structure of Papa Stour is largely made up of ashes and lavas from volcanic activity associated with this period , including bands of solidified volcanic ash and lava rhyolite , but there is also a Devonian fish bed at Lamba Banks . There are numerous large boulders deposited by Pleistocene glaciation .
When viewed in mass , as in a spore print , the spores appear cream to yellow colored . Viewed with a light microscope , the spores are translucent hyaline , elliptical to nearly spherical in shape , with amyloid warts , and have dimensions of 7 9 by 5 . 5 7 . 5 m . Scanning electron microscopy reveals reticulations on the spore surface . The hymenium is the spore - producing tissue layer of the fruit body , and consists of hyphae that extend into the gills and terminate as end cells . Various cell types can be observed in the hymenium , and the cells have microscopic characteristics that may be used to help identify or distinguish species in cases where the macroscopic characters may be ambiguous . The spore - bearing cells , the basidia , are four - spored and measure 37 45 m long by 8 10 m wide at the thickest point . Cystidia are terminal cells of hyphae in the hymenium which do not produce spores , and function in aiding spore dispersal , and maintaining favorable humidity around developing spores . The pleurocystidia are cystidia that are found on the face of a gill ; they are 40 56 by 6 . 4 8 m , roughly spindle - shaped , and have a constricted apex . The cheilocystidia located on the edge of a gill are abundant , and are 40 . 0 45 . 6 by 5 . 6 7 . 2 m .
It is estimated that 7 to 8 million people , mostly in Mexico , Central America and South America , have Chagas disease as of 2013 . In 2006 , Chagas was estimated to result in 12 , 500 deaths per year . Most people with the disease are poor , and most people with the disease do not realize they are infected . Large - scale population movements have increased the areas where Chagas disease is found and these include many European countries and the United States . These areas have also seen an increase in the years up to 2014 . The disease was first described in 1909 by Carlos Chagas after whom it is named . It affects more than 150 other animals .

Throughout her career , Simone assembled a collection of songs that would later become standards in her repertoire . Some were songs that she wrote herself , while others were new arrangements of other standards , and others had been written especially for the singer . Her first hit song in America was her rendition of George Gershwin 's I Loves You , Porgy 1958 . It peaked at number 18 in the pop singles chart and number 2 on the black singles chart . During that same period Simone recorded My Baby Just Cares for Me , which would become her biggest success years later , in 1987 , after it was featured in a 1986 Chanel No. 5 perfume commercial . A music video was also created by Aardman Studios . Well known songs from her Philips albums include Don 't Let Me Be Misunderstood on Broadway - Blues - Ballads 1964 , I Put a Spell on You , Ne me quitte pas a rendition of a Jacques Brel song and Feeling Good on I Put a Spell On You 1965 , Lilac Wine and Wild Is the Wind on Wild is the Wind 1966 .

In the centre , the main attack along the Buin Road began at 08 : 30 on 20 May after 20 minutes of strafing by New Zealand Corsairs had prepared the ground . Advancing under a creeping barrage , and with mortar and machine gun support , the 24th Infantry Battalion moved forward with three companies up front and one held back in reserve , along with two troops of Matilda tanks . Mostly the forward companies reached their objectives , but one of the companies was halted just short of their objective and was forced to dig - in overnight after coming under heavy small arms and artillery fire and losing four killed and five wounded . The attack was resumed the following day , and the Australians were able to advance to the Pororei ford ; however , they were prevented from moving any further as the Japanese were still concentrated in large numbers further to the west where an Australian patrol encountered 70 Japanese and were forced to go to ground . Finally , a company from the 24th Infantry Battalion was able to move on to the high ground on Egan 's Ridge , which they found to be heavily mined and booby trapped . Engineers and assault pioneers were called up to clear the feature .
For 50 years , DuMont was the only major broadcast television network to cease operations , until CBS Corporation and Time Warner shut down two other struggling networks , UPN and The WB , in September 2006 to create The CW Television Network whose schedule was originally composed largely of programs from both of its predecessor networks .
Sylvester detects the influence of late works by Titian in other aspects , especially in the deep and rich colouring , Vel zquez 's portrayals of Philip IV , and agrees with identification of pastels of Edgar Degas as a source . He believes Bacon borrowed from Degas the use of parallel heavy folds to create the illusion of what Degas described as shuttering , as seen in the earlier artist 's After the Bath , Woman drying herself . Sylvester makes a further direct link between the folds and the transparent veil in Titian 's Portrait of Cardinal Filippo Archinto . He believes the folds serve to push the viewer back , creating a distance from the subject , an effect he sees as similar to the separation between and orchestra and setting ; others view the folds as more closely resembling the bars of a prison . Sylvester describes them as an accentuation of background verticals into stripes that are made to appear as if they pass through the sitter . In his Interviews with Francis Bacon series of books , he asked Bacon why he found the effect so poignant . The artist replied , Well , it means that the sensation doesn 't come straight out at you but slides slowly and gently through the gaps . 
In Crete , the battalion was tasked with the defence of Maleme airfield and the overlooking hill , Point 107 . Andrew was ordered to maintain control of his positions at all costs . Forced to disperse the companies of his battalion widely to cover his positions , he lost contact with most of his units after German paratroopers began landing in the area on 20 May . Failing to receive any support from his brigade commander following a request for assistance , and fearing most of his command overrun after a failed counterattack by his small reserve , he withdrew his remaining units . As it happened , most of his forward companies remained intact and were subsequently able to withdraw themselves after finding they had been abandoned . Andrew was criticised for his withdrawal , which led to the loss of Maleme airfield . This was a significant factor in allowing the German forces to become established on Crete . He and the surviving elements of his battalion were later evacuated from Crete .

The wave continued westward and related thunderstorm activity increased during the following week . The convective system organized into Tropical Depression Twenty - E on September 28 nearly midway between Mexico and Hawaii . Initially , the depression drifted toward the northwest due to a large upper - level trough located to its west . Polo strengthened rapidly into a hurricane early on September 30 , with its winds peaking at 75 mph 121 km h . Since the storm was very small , vertical wind shear caused significant weakening thereafter . On October 1 , Polo regained tropical storm strength as it was crossing into the north Central Pacific basin . It dissipated as a tropical cyclone later that day . There were no casualties or damages caused by Polo .
The new marketing strategy did not prove particularly successful , and in 2004 Diageo returned to regional advertising . AMV BBDO were presented with the choice of coming up with either a new theme to appeal to the 18 35 British male demographic or a new angle on the tried and tested Good things ... concept . A number of ideas were put forward , including The Longest Wait . From this concept , noitulovE was quickly plotted out : the advert would show three individuals waiting 500 , 000 , 000 years before finally taking their first sip of Guinness , the timeline compressed into a 50 - second clip . The decision to run the Evolution sequence in reverse was taken fairly early , as it was felt that it would better hold viewers ' interest during a 60 - second television spot .

Those within the regime are also a mix of fictional characters and real people . President Balaguer is real , but the entire Cabral family is completely fictional . According to Wolff , Vargas Llosa uses history as a starting point in constructing a fictionalized account of Trujillo 's spiritual colonization of the Dominican Republic as experienced by one Dominican family . The fictional Cabral family allows Vargas Llosa to show two sides of the Trujillo regime : through Agustin , the reader sees ultimate dedication and sacrifice to the leader of the nation ; through Urania , the violence of the regime and the legacy of pain it left behind . Vargas Llosa also fictionalized the internal thoughts of the characters who were non - fictional , especially those of the Goat himself . According to literary scholar Richard Patterson , Vargas Llosa 's expands all the way into the very dark area of Trujillo 's consciousness as the storyteller dares to conceive it . 
Co - creators J. J. Abrams , Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci , and executive producer Jeff Pinkner wrote the episode . Paul A. Edwards served as the director , his first such credit for the series . In developing Fringe , the co - creators did not want to make the series too serialized , as this was a complaint often directed at Abrams ' television series Alias . They wanted to find a balance between standalone stories and serialized content , and studied procedural dramas such as Law and Order and CSI : Crime Scene Investigation for inspiration . Kurztman explained , While we make sure that our episodes are self - contained have a beginning , a middle , and an end the character stories can be serialized . They don 't have to resolve themselves over the course of one show . The Same Old Story was Fringe 's first regular episode , and some journalists viewed it as an example of how the series would be structured .

Colonel Hill went forward in the evening with the 4 . 2 - inch mortar platoon to its position at the base of Hill 209 where the mortarmen prepared to set up their weapons .
Continued effects from shear stripped the cyclone of all deep convection , and by September 14 only a band of cirrus clouds remained in association with Uleki . The JTWC issued their final warning on the system at 00 : 00 UTC that day accordingly . The JMA maintained the system as a tropical depression as the former typhoon began turning to the east . Uleki later transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 16 as it accelerated to the east . The system dissipated the following day near the International Dateline , far from any major landmasses .
During the Kerch - Feodosiya Operation Krasnyi Kavkaz sailed into the harbor of Feodosiya on 29 December 1941 and disembarked reinforcements and provided gunfire support for Soviet troops already ashore . She was hit seventeen times by Axis artillery and mortar fire in retaliation . On 1 and 3 January she ferried supplies and reinforcements for the Soviet bridgehead on the Kerch Peninsula . On the return voyage she was severely damaged by German Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive - bombers from II . StG 77 . Four near - misses close to her stern damaged her steering , her left propeller shaft , blew off one propeller and put enough holes in her stern that flooding caused her draft to increase by 5 metres 16 ft . She made it to Novorossiysk , escorted by the destroyer Sposobnyi , where she was patched up enough to make to Poti where more permanent repairs could be made . These took until October 1942 and the opportunity was taken to reinforce her anti - aircraft armament .

On 23 May 1915 , between two and four hours after news of the Italian declaration of war reached the main Austro - Hungarian naval base at Pola , Zr nyi and the rest of the fleet departed to bombard the Italian and Montenegrin coast . Their focus was on the important naval base at Ancona , and later the coast of Montenegro . The bombardment of Montenegro was part of the larger Austro - Hungarian campaign against the Kingdoms of Montenegro and Serbia , who were members of the Entente , during the first half of 1915 . The attack on Ancona was an immense success , and the ships were unopposed during the operation . The bombardment of the province and the surrounding area resulted in the destruction of an Italian steamer in the port of Ancona itself , and an Italian destroyer , Turbine , was severely damaged further south . On the shore , the infrastructure of the port of Ancona , as well as the surrounding towns , were severely damaged . The railroad yard in Ancona , as well as the port facilities in the town , were damaged or destroyed . The local shore batteries were also suppressed . During the bombardment , Zr nyi also helped to destroy a train , a railway station , and a bridge at Senigallia . Additional targets that were damaged or destroyed included wharves , warehouses , oil tanks , radio stations , and the local barracks . Sixty - three Italians , both civilians and military personnel , were killed in the bombardment . By the time Italian ships from Taranto and Brindisi arrived on the scene , the Austro - Hungarians were safely back in Pola .
The New Zealand riflemen soon gained a footing on Mount Royston , aided by accurate and rapid shooting from the Somerset Royal Horse Artillery Battery . By 16 : 00 , the attack had proceeded to a point where Chaytor arranged with the 5th Mounted Brigade for a squadron of Royal Gloucestershire Hussars and two troops of the Worcestershire Yeomanry to gallop against the southern spur of Mount Royston . They easily took the spur , the defenders not waiting for the onslaught of the mounted charge . From the crest of the spur , the Gloucestershire squadron shot down the horse teams of an Austrian , German or Ottoman battery of pack guns concentrated in the hollow behind the spur , and the attacking force began to surrender . The New Zealand Mounted Rifle and 5th Mounted Brigades were supported by leading infantry battalions of the 127th Manchester Brigade which had just arrived when Ottoman and German soldiers began to surrender en masse . At about 18 : 00 , 500 prisoners , two machine guns and the pack battery were captured , and the outer flank of the attacking force was completely routed .
The most noted prerogative power that affects the judicial system is the prerogative of mercy , which has two elements : the granting of pardons and the granting of nolle prosequi . Pardons may eliminate the pains , penalties and punishments from a criminal conviction , though they do not remove convictions themselves . This power is commonly exercised on the advice of the Secretary of State for the Home Department ; the monarch has no direct involvement in its use . Exercises of this power may also take the form of commutations , a limited form of pardon where the sentences is reduced , on certain conditions . The granting of a pardon is not subject to judicial review , as confirmed by Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service , but the courts have chosen to criticise its application or lack thereof , as in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department , ex parte Bentley . Granting nolle prosequi is done by the Attorney General of England and Wales or the equivalent in Scotland or Northern Ireland in the name of the crown , to stop legal proceedings against an individual . This is not reviewable by the courts , as confirmed by R v Comptroller of Patents , and does not count as an acquittal ; the defendant may be brought before the courts on the same charge at a later date .
Peter is first said to have been crucified upside - down in Rome during Nero 's reign but not by Nero in the apocryphal Acts of Peter c . 200 . The account ends with Paul still alive and Nero abiding by God 's command not to persecute any more Christians .

The barrel - shaped nave roof dates possibly from the early 16th century . The early 17th - century Stanley pew at the eastern end of the south aisle is at the level of an upper storey , and is entered by a flight of steps from outside the church . Its front is richly carved and displays six panels with coats of arms . Richards states that it is one of the finest of its kind in the country and that it is unique in Cheshire . At the west end of the church is a late - 18th - century musicians ' gallery , whose front panel has painted coats of arms . The gallery contains the organ which replaces an earlier organ . This was presented by Lady Fabia Stanley in 1875 and was made by Hill and Company of London at a cost of 350 equivalent to 30 , 000 in 2015 , An oak document chest in the tower has been dated to 1686 . The 14th - century font was buried in the churchyard during the Commonwealth , dug up in 1821 and restored to use in the church in 1924 . It consists of a plain circular bowl on four short cylindrical columns with moulded bases . Richards considers it to be one of the finest examples of 14th - century work in Cheshire . The church has two old Bibles , a Vinegar Bible and a Breeches Bible .

The poem relies on a first - person narration style similar to Ode to Psyche . It begins with a classical scene from an urn in a similar manner to Ode on a Grecian Urn , but the scene in Indolence is allegorical . The opening describes three figures that operate as three fates :
Geologists have debated about what caused the slide debris to travel the distance it did . The air cushion theory , an early hypothesis , postulated that a layer of air was trapped between the mass of rock and the mountain , which caused the rock to move a greater distance than would otherwise be expected . Acoustic fluidization is another theory , which suggests that large masses of material create seismic energy that reduces friction and causes the debris to flow down the mountain as though it is a fluid . Geologists created the term debris avalanche to describe the Frank Slide .
While working on the animated television series Rocko 's Modern Life , Phineas and Ferb co - founders Dan Povenmire and Jeff Swampy Marsh utilized several recurring elements in the episodes that they wrote . Among these were actions sequences and chase scenes . Povenmire and Marsh wanted to reuse these elements in their series and chose Perry to execute it . The pair gave him a consistent and continuous nemesis in the form of Doofenshmirtz as a means of allowing viewers to get to know him .

Bedell sponsored several bold initiatives during his tenure in the United States House of Representatives . One initiative , which came from his constituents ' problems with the barge industry , focused on waterway usage fees . He introduced legislation in 1977 that would require the barge industry to pay a fee for using the waterways which , Bedell pointed out , the Government paid millions of dollars to create and maintain . Bedell 's original plan set the rate the barge industry paid as directly related to the amount the Government spent on waterway projects . This would have the additional effect of helping curb unnecessary waterway projects , and it was the same plan proposed by Pete Domenici in the Senate .

The 1973 Atlantic hurricane season was the first season to use the Saffir Simpson hurricane scale , a scale developed in 1971 by Herbert Saffir and Robert Simpson to rate the intensity of tropical cyclones . The season produced 24 tropical and subtropical cyclones , of which only 8 reached storm intensity , 4 became hurricanes , and only 1 reached major hurricane status . Although more active than the 1972 season , 1973 brought few storms of note . Nearly half of the season 's storms affected land , one of which resulted in severe damage .

And some of those youngsters did die and it was a very difficult thing for me to be part of , because you know , you re powerless , when you re part of the big team .
At Winnellie , the battalion was allocated a large defensive zone between Nightcliff , Lee Point and Shoal Bay , which included a large beach frontage , as well as extensive swamp lands and creeks further inland . Throughout November , extensive work was undertaken improving the camp and preparing this position with fortified emplacements . They also undertook various other garrison duties such as guarding ammunition dumps , and road and railway construction . Heavy summer rains flooded the camp and surrounding area and as well as hampering construction , brought a wave of dengue fever amongst the battalion and the threat of crocodile attacks as the creeks within the battalion position swelled ; the battalion s mascot , a dog named Gunner , fell victim . News of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and invasion of Malaya came in early December and with it a need to bolster Australian forces in the Pacific . As Bennett pressed harder for reinforcements , on 23 December the 2 4th Machine Gun Battalion received orders to embark for Malaya .
Bacon said that chance played a significant role in his work , and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge . This was especially the case in the mid to late 1940s , a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in Soho casinos and poker rooms . The following morning he would often approach his canvas in a bad mood of drinking ... under tremendous hangovers and drink ; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing . He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work : an image often would morph mid - way through into something quite different from what he had first intended . He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist . To him , lifestyle and art were intertwined ; he said that perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer . This is very evident in the 1949 series , which began as a rather morbid study of a collapsed head , but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of Vel zquez masterpieces , and arrived at an image that was to preoccupy Bacon for the subsequent 20 years .

As of 2006 , the star with the highest known absolute magnitude is LBV 1806 - 20 , with a magnitude of 14 . 2 . This star is at least 5 , 000 , 000 times more luminous than the Sun . The least luminous stars that are currently known are located in the NGC 6397 cluster . The faintest red dwarfs in the cluster were magnitude 26 , while a 28th magnitude white dwarf was also discovered . These faint stars are so dim that their light is as bright as a birthday candle on the Moon when viewed from the Earth .
The practice of issuing the newspaper six days a week became harder after the outbreak of the First World War .

Other methods for elucidating the cellular location of proteins requires the use of known compartmental markers for regions such as the ER , the Golgi , lysosomes or vacuoles , mitochondria , chloroplasts , plasma membrane , etc . With the use of fluorescently tagged versions of these markers or of antibodies to known markers , it becomes much simpler to identify the localization of a protein of interest . For example , indirect immunofluorescence will allow for fluorescence colocalization and demonstration of location . Fluorescent dyes are used to label cellular compartments for a similar purpose .

The novel generated huge controversy in Latin America : some Venezuelan and Colombian politicians described its depiction of Bol var as profane . According to Stavans , they accused Garc a M rquez of defaming the larger - than - life reputation of a historical figure who , during the nineteenth century , struggled to unite the vast Hispanic world . The novel 's publication provoked outrage from many Latin American politicians and intellectuals because its portrayal of the General is not the saintly image long cherished by many . Mexico 's ambassador to Austria , Francisco Cuevas Cancino , wrote a damning letter , which was widely publicized in Mexico City , objecting to the portrayal of Bol var . He stated : The novel is plagued with errors of fact , conception , fairness , understanding of the historical moment and ignorance of its consequences ... It has served the enemies of Latin America , who care only that they can now denigrate Bol var , and with him all of us . Even the novel 's admirers , such as the leading Venezuelan diplomat and writer Arturo Uslar Pietri , worried that some facts were stretched . Garc a M rquez believes , however , that Latin America has to discover the General 's labyrinth to recognize and deal with its own maze of problems .

The music incorporates elements of jazz and 20th - century avant - garde . The instruments in the orchestra frequently interrupt both each other and the female voices , and some sections of the composition seem as though they are improvised . Laborintus II makes use of both traditional percussion instruments and electronic sounds , and their interplay serves to erect musical and textural architectures , then disassemble them quickly . Max Feldman has compared the style to that of Raymond Scott .
West Hendford Cricket Ground was a first - class cricket ground located in Yeovil , Somerset . The land for the ground was first leased by Yeovil Cricket Club in 1874 , and was also used for a range of other sports , most significantly hosting Yeovil Rugby Club in the 1890s , and then again from 1935 until the ground was closed .

Starting in 1988 , Adorj n has argued in a series of books and magazine articles that Black is OK ! Alone amongst modern writers , Adorj n claims that White starts the game with essentially no advantage . He writes , In my opinion , the only obvious advantage for White is that if he or she plays for a draw , and does so well , then Black can hardly avoid this without taking obvious risks . Adorj n goes so far as to claim that , The tale of White 's advantage is a delusion , belief in it is based on mass psychosis . Rowson writes that Adorj n 's contention is one of the most important chess ideas of the last two decades ... because it has shaken our assumption that White begins the game with some advantage , and revealed its ideological nature . However , Rowson rejects Adorj n 's claim that White has essentially no advantage , reasoning that ' White is better ' and ' Black is OK ' need not be mutually exclusive claims .

Hurricane Janet was the most powerful tropical cyclone of the season and one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record . The hurricane formed from a tropical wave east of the Lesser Antilles on September 21 . Moving toward the west across the Caribbean Sea , Janet fluctuated in intensity , but generally strengthened before reaching its peak intensity as a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir Simpson hurricane scale with winds of 175 mph 280 km h . The intense hurricane made landfall at that intensity near Chetumal , Mexico on September 28 . Janet 's landfall as a Category 5 hurricane on the Yucat n Peninsula marked the first recorded instance that a storm of such intensity in the Atlantic basin made on a continental mainland , with all previous storms making landfall as Category 5 hurricanes on islands . After weakening over the Yucat n Peninsula , it moved into the Bay of Campeche , where it slightly strengthened before making its final landfall near Veracruz on September 29 . Janet quickly weakened over Mexico 's mountainous terrain before dissipating on September 30 .

Found in a broad arc from Far North Queensland through New South Wales and Victoria to Tasmania and southeastern South Australia , the noisy miner primarily inhabits dry , open eucalypt forests that lack understory shrubs . These include forests dominated by spotted gum , box and ironbark , as well as in degraded woodland where the understory has been cleared , such as recently burned areas , farming and grazing areas , roadside reserves , and suburban parks and gardens with trees and grass but without dense shrubbery . The density of noisy miner populations has significantly increased in many locations across its range , particularly human - dominated habitats . The popularity of nectar - producing garden plants such as the large - flowered grevilleas was thought to play a role in its proliferation , but studies now show that the noisy miner has benefited primarily from landscaping practices that create open areas dominated by eucalypts .
However , as soon as the soldiers from the 30th and 33rd Ranger Battalions arrived at the landing zone , they were quickly overwhelmed by the Viet Cong in a deadly ambush . The entire 30th Ranger Battalion was then committed to join the attack , but they too did not initially succeed in penetrating the strong Viet Cong defensive lines . Several more companies of the Rangers then arrived for an attack from multiple directions . Two companies of the 33rd Ranger Battalion advanced from the northeast . One of them came to the outskirts of the village but was unable to break through the enemy defenses . The other one , trying to outflank the enemy , had been lured into a kill zone in open terrain at the coffee plantation and were quickly obliterated in an ambush by the three VC battalions using heavy weapons . The two companies suffered a 70 percent casualty rate , and survivors were forced to retreat to the nearby Catholic church . The 30th Rangers had more success by assaulting from the western direction and succeeded in fighting their way into the village , aided by local residents . It however also suffered heavy losses , with the battalion commander and his American adviser severely wounded . The local civilians in B nh Gi retrieved weapons and ammunition from the dead Rangers , and hid the wounded government soldiers from the Viet Cong . The 38th Ranger Battalion , on the other hand , landed on the battlefield unopposed by the Viet Cong , and they immediately advanced on B nh Gi from the south . Soldiers from the 38th Rangers spent the whole day fighting but they could not break through their enemies ' defences to link up with the survivors hiding in the church , and fell back after calling in mortar fire to decimate Viet Cong fighters moving to encircle them .

Until 1995 , it was assumed that the corn crake is monogamous , but it transpires that a male may have a shifting home range , and mate with two or more females , moving on when laying is almost complete . The male 's territory can vary from 3 to 51 ha 7 . 4 to 126 . 0 acres , but averages 15 . 7 ha 39 acres . The female has a much smaller range , averaging only 5 . 5 ha 14 acres . A male will challenge an intruder by calling with his wings drooped and his head pointing forward . Usually the stranger moves off ; if it stays , the two birds square up with heads and necks raised and the wings touching the ground . They then run around giving the growling call and lunging at each other . A real fight may ensue , with the birds leaping at each other and pecking , and sometimes kicking . Females play no part in defending the territory .

Recording began at Ascot Sound Studios , Lennon 's newly built home studio at Tittenhurst Park , in May 1971 , with final overdubs taking place at the Record Plant , in New York City , during July . Relaxed and patient , the sessions began during the late morning , running to just before dinner in the early evening . Lennon taught the musicians the chord progression and a working arrangement for Imagine , rehearsing the song until he deemed the musicians ready to record . In his attempt to recreate Lennon 's desired sound , Spector had some early tapings feature Lennon and Nicky Hopkins playing in different octaves on one piano . He also initially attempted to record the piano part with Lennon playing the white baby grand in the couple 's all - white room . However , after having deemed the room 's acoustics unsuitable , Spector abandoned the idea in favour of the superior environment of Lennon 's home studio . They completed the session in minutes , recording three takes and choosing the second one for release . The finished recording featured Lennon on piano and vocal , Klaus Voormann on bass guitar , Alan White on drums and the Flux Fiddlers on strings .

British conservative politician Oliver Stanley agreed to accept the evacuees in the United Kingdom , but he argued with Gibraltar over the number of people involved . The Governor , he declared , had given the number of evacuees first as 13 , 000 , then as 14 , 000 and finally as 16 , 000 . He asked for the situation to be clarified , stressing the shortage of accommodation in Britain and insisting that only 13 , 000 could be accepted , 2 , 000 of whom were to be sent to the Portuguese Atlantic island of Madeira . The situation , replied General Liddell on 19 July , is that this is a fortress liable to heavy and immediate attack and there should be no civilians here whereas there are 22 , 000 . The 13 , 000 was the number sent to Morocco , and more would have been sent had the situation there not altered . In London the evacuees were placed in the hands of the Ministry of Health , and many were housed in Kensington area . Concern for them in Gibraltar mounted as the air raids against London intensified , coupled with the arrival of harrowing letters , describing the circumstances in which the evacuees were living .

The game that became Fez began in a collaboration between Montreal - based Phil Fish and Toronto - based Shawn McGrath on McGrath 's idea for a puzzle game : a four - sided 3D space with each side in 2D , similar to Fish 's 3D pixels voxels as incorporated into Fez . The entirety of Fez 's design , lore , and art descends from this game mechanic . Fish provided the project 's art and credited his influence to Shigeru Miyamoto and Hayao Miyazaki . Fish and McGrath 's partnership crumbled due to creative differences , as Fish wanted to create a platform game . Fish continued to work on the game in his spare time and announced his search for a programmer on DeviantArt , and the first person to reply , Renaud B dard , became lead programmer . They were both the same age and living in Montreal .

Arthur Ransome described The Importance ... as the most trivial of Wilde 's society plays , and the only one that produces that peculiar exhilaration of the spirit by which we recognise the beautiful . It is , he wrote , precisely because it is consistently trivial that it is not ugly . Ellmann says that The Importance of Being Earnest touched on many themes Wilde had been building since the 1880s the languor of aesthetic poses was well established and Wilde takes it as a starting point for the two protagonists . While Salome , An Ideal Husband and The Picture of Dorian Gray had dwelt on more serious wrongdoing , vice in Earnest is represented by Algy 's craving for cucumber sandwiches . Wilde told Robert Ross that the play 's theme was That we should treat all trivial things in life very seriously , and all serious things of life with a sincere and studied triviality . The theme is hinted at in the play 's ironic title , and earnestness is repeatedly alluded to in the dialogue , Algernon says in Act II , one has to be serious about something if one is to have any amusement in life but goes on to reproach Jack for ' being serious about everything ' . Blackmail and corruption had haunted the double lives of Dorian Gray and Sir Robert Chiltern in An Ideal Husband , but in Earnest the protagonists ' duplicity Algernon 's bunburying and Worthing 's double life as Jack and Ernest is undertaken for more innocent purposes largely to avoid unwelcome social obligations . While much theatre of the time tackled serious social and political issues , Earnest is superficially about nothing at all . It refuses to play the game of other dramatists of the period , for instance Bernard Shaw , who used their characters to draw audiences to grander ideals .
Because it is both one of the first dinosaurs described and one of the best - known dinosaurs , Iguanodon has been well - placed as a barometer of changing public and scientific perceptions on dinosaurs . Its reconstructions have gone through three stages : the elephantine quadrupedal horn - snouted reptile satisfied the Victorians , then a bipedal but still fundamentally reptilian animal using its tail to prop itself up dominated the early 20th century , but was slowly overturned during the 1960s by its current , more agile and dynamic representation , able to shift from two legs to all fours .

Baltimore solicited a new charter from the king . In order to found an alternative colony in a less hostile climate further south , he requested a precinct in Virginia , where he could grow tobacco . He wrote to his friends Francis Cottington and Thomas Wentworth enlisting their support for this new proposal , admitting the impression his abandonment of Avalon might make in England : I shall rayse a great deal of talke and discourse and be censured by most men of giddiness and levity sic . The king , perhaps guided by Baltimore 's friends at court , replied expressing concern for Baltimore 's health and gently advising him to forget colonial schemes and return to England , where he would be treated with every respect : Men of your condition and breeding are fitter for other imployments than the framing of new plantations , which commonly have rugged laborious beginnings , and require much greater meanes , in managing them , than usually the power of one private subject can reach unto .
Despite the uncertainty of its specific location , Castell Avloed appears to have been situated in territory formerly controlled by Iago , and there is reason to suspect that after Iago 's fall and Cynan 's flight mar oversaw military actions against Gruffudd . Three years later , for example , Brut y Tywysogion and the B and C versions of Annales Cambri report that this Welsh king was captured by forces from Dublin . The episode is further elaborated upon by a sixteenth - century text compiled by David Powell died 1598 and a seventeenth - century text by compiled by James Ware . According to these admittedly late versions of events , Gruffudd was captured by the Dubliners in the context of them supporting the cause of Cynan . The accounts further state that Gruffudd managed to escape his captors when the Dubliners were counterattacked by Welsh forces before they could return to Ireland . The evidence of Cynan cooperating with the Dubliners against Gruffudd suggests that , not only was mar personally involved as king , but that the Welsh fortress of Castell Avloed was still controlled by the Dubliners .

In the holotype of C. casuarius , the sides and tail of the body are covered in scales of several types . Polygonal tuberculate scales , covered in small bumps , vary in size over the body . Conical limpet - like scales are only preserved on a fold of skin preserved on the back of the tibia , but which was probably from the bottom of the belly , rather than the leg . Separating the polygonal scales of C. casuarius are shieldlike scales , arranged close together in rows . Ossified tendons are present on all the vertebrae , except for those in the cervical region . On no vertebrae do the tendons extend below the transverse processes . Each tendon is flattened at its origin , and transversely ovoid in the central rod , ending at a rounded point .
While covering the suicides , several media outlets focused on Applewhite 's sexuality ; the New York Post dubbed him the Gay Guru . Gay rights activist Troy Perry argued that Applewhite 's repression , and society 's rejection , of same - sex relationships ultimately led to his suicide .

Zeller argues that Applewhite 's sexuality was not the primary driving force behind his asceticism , which he believes resulted from a variety of factors , though he grants sexuality a role .

The residential area of Tikal covers an estimated 60 square kilometres 23 sq mi , much of which has not yet been cleared , mapped , or excavated . A huge set of earthworks discovered by Dennis E. Puleston and Donald Callender in the 1960s rings Tikal with a 6 - metre 20 ft wide trench behind a rampart . The 16 square kilometres 6 . 2 sq mi area around the site core has been intensively mapped ; it may have enclosed an area of some 125 square kilometres 48 sq mi see below . Population estimates place the demographic size of the site between 10 , 000 and 90 , 000 , and possibly 425 , 000 in the surrounding area . Recently , a project exploring the defensive earthworks has shown that the scale of the earthworks is highly variable and that in many places it is inconsequential as a defensive feature . In addition , some parts of the earthwork were integrated into a canal system .

Clay called for rotation but the aircraft sped off the end of the runway before it could lift off . It then struck a low earthen wall adjacent to a ditch , becoming momentarily airborne , clipped the airport perimeter fence with its landing gear , and smashed into trees , separating the fuselage and flight deck from the tail . The aircraft struck the ground about 1 , 000 feet 300 m from the end of the runway . Forty - nine of the 50 people on board perished in the accident ; most of them died instantly in the initial impact . The resulting fire destroyed the aircraft .
Critical response today is mostly positive , with Rotten Tomatoes giving a 72 rating . But most reviews pointed out various flaws in the film . James Berardinelli said that the first half was good , but during the second half , as the plot escalates beyond the bounds of preposterousness , that the film starts to fragment , criticising Blofeld 's appearance and stating rockets that swallow up spacecraft are a bit too extravagant .

Derfflinger and L tzow were 210 m 689 ft 0 in long at the waterline and 210 . 40 m 690 ft 3 in long overall . Hindenburg was slightly longer , at 212 . 50 m 697 ft 2 in at the waterline and 212 . 80 m 698 ft 2 in overall . All three ships had a beam of 29 m 95 ft 2 in , and a draft of between 9 . 20 m 30 ft 2 in forward and 9 . 57 m 31 ft 5 in aft . The first two ships were designed to displace 26 , 600 tonnes 26 , 200 long tons with a standard load , and up to 31 , 200 tonnes 30 , 700 long tons at combat weight . Hindenburg displaced slightly more , at 26 , 947 tonnes 26 , 521 long tons standard and 31 , 500 tonnes 31 , 000 long tons fully laden . The ships ' hulls were constructed from longitudinal steel frames , over which the outer hull plates were riveted . Derfflinger 's hull contained 16 watertight compartments , though L tzow and Hindenburg had an additional seventeenth compartment . All three ships had a double bottom that ran for 65 of the length of the hull . This was a decrease from preceding German battlecruisers , which had a double bottom for at least 75 of the hull .

The occurrence of convection in the outer envelope of a main sequence star depends on the star 's mass . Stars with several times the mass of the Sun have a convection zone deep within the interior and a radiative zone in the outer layers . Smaller stars such as the Sun are just the opposite , with the convective zone located in the outer layers . Red dwarf stars with less than 0 . 4 M are convective throughout , which prevents the accumulation of a helium core . For most stars the convective zones will also vary over time as the star ages and the constitution of the interior is modified .
Jan Werich was originally cast by producer Harry Saltzman to play Blofeld . Upon his arrival at the Pinewood set , both producer Albert R. Broccoli and director Lewis Gilbert felt that he was a poor choice , resembling a poor , benevolent Santa Claus . Nonetheless , in an attempt to make the casting work , Gilbert continued filming . After several days , both Gilbert and Broccoli determined that Werich was not menacing enough , and recast Blofeld with Donald Pleasence in the role . Pleasence 's ideas for Blofeld 's appearance included a hump , a limp , a beard , and a lame hand , before he settled on the scar . He found it uncomfortable , though , because of the glue that attached it to his eye .

During the early hours of December 28 , 1964 , elements of the Viet Cong 271st Regiment and the 445th Company , signaled their main attack on B nh Gi by penetrating the village 's eastern perimeter . There , they clashed with members of the South Vietnamese Popular Force militiamen , which numbered about 65 personnel . The South Vietnamese militia fighters proved no match for the Viet Cong and their overwhelming firepower , so they quickly retreated into underground bunkers , and called for help . Once the village was captured , Colonel Ta Minh Kham , the Viet Cong regimental commander , established his command post in the main village church and waited for fresh reinforcements , which came in the form of heavy mortars , machine guns and recoil - less rifles . To counter South Vietnamese helicopter assaults , Colonel Kham 's troops set up a network of defensive fortifications around the village , with trenches and bunkers protected by land mines and barbed wire . The local Catholic priest , who was also the village chief , sent a bicycle messenger out to the B R a district headquarters to ask for a relief force . In response , the B R a district chief sent out elements of two Vietnamese Rangers battalions to retake B nh Gi . On December 29 , two companies of the ARVN 33rd Ranger Battalion and a company from the 30th Ranger Battalion were airlifted into area located west of B nh Gi , by helicopters from the U.S. 118th Aviation Company to face an enemy force of unknown size .
During his re - examination of Iguanodon , David Norman was able to show that this posture was unlikely , because the long tail was stiffened with ossified tendons . To get the tripodal pose , the tail would literally have to be broken . Putting the animal in a horizontal posture makes many aspects of the arms and pectoral girdle more understandable . For example , the hand is relatively immobile , with the three central fingers grouped together , bearing hoof - like phalanges , and able to hyperextend . This would have allowed them to bear weight . The wrist is also relatively immobile , and the arms and shoulder bones robust . These features all suggest that the animal spent time on all fours .

At national level in the UK , Mosley competed in over 40 races in 1966 and 1967 ; he won 12 and set several class lap records . In 1968 , he formed the London Racing Team in partnership with driver Chris Lambert to compete in European Formula Two , which at that time was the level of racing just below Formula One . Their cars were prepared by Frank Williams , later a Formula One team owner . It was a dangerous time to race . Mosley 's first Formula Two race was the 1968 Deutschland Troph e , at Hockenheim in which double world champion Jim Clark was killed , and within two years both of Mosley 's 1968 team mates , Piers Courage and Chris Lambert were dead in racing accidents . Mosley 's best result that year was an eighth place at a non - championship race at Monza . Engine builder Brian Hart says that as a driver , Mosley might not have been particularly quick , but he was a thinking driver . He kept out of trouble and generally used his head . a 
Finkelstein grew up in Borough Park , then Mill Basin , both in Brooklyn , New York , where he attended James Madison High School . In his memoir , Finkelstein recalls his strong youthful identification with the outrage that his mother , witness to the genocidal atrocities of World War II , felt at the carnage wrought by the United States in Vietnam . One childhood friend recalls his mother 's emotional investment in left - wing humanitarian causes as bordering on hysteria . He had internalized her indignation , a trait which he admits rendered him insufferable when talking of the Vietnam War , and which imbued him with a holier - than - thou attitude at the time which he now regrets . But Finkelstein regards his absorption of his mother 's outlook the refusal to put aside a sense of moral outrage in order to get on with one 's life as a virtue . Subsequently , his reading of Noam Chomsky played an important role in tailoring the passion bequeathed to him by his mother to the necessity of maintaining intellectual rigor .
In the writing of his novel , Qian Cai used a different character when spelling Zhou 's given name . Instead of the original character meaning similar , it was changed to , meaning rude or rustic .

Haifa al- ' Atiqa Arabic : Ancient Haifa is another name used by locals to refer to Tell es - Samak , as it was the site of Haifa when it was a hamlet of 250 residents , before it was moved in 1764 - 5 to a new fortified site founded by Zahir al - Umar 1 . 5 miles 2 . 4 kilometres to the east . The new village , the nucleus of modern Haifa , was originally named al - imara al - jadida Arabic : the new construction , but locals called it Haifa al - Jadida Arabic : New Haifa at first , and then simply Haifa . In the early 20th century , Haifa al ' Atiqa was repopulated as a predominantly Arab Christian neighborhood of Haifa as it expanded outward from its new location .

The ironclad age saw the development of explosive torpedoes as naval weapons , which helped complicate the design and tactics of ironclad fleets . The first torpedoes were static mines , used extensively in the American Civil War . That conflict also saw the development of the spar torpedo , an explosive charge pushed against the hull of a warship by a small boat . For the first time , a large warship faced a serious threat from a smaller one and given the relative inefficiency of shellfire against ironclads , the threat from the spar torpedo was taken seriously . The U.S. Navy converted four of its monitors to become turretless armored spar - torpedo vessels while under construction in 1864 5 , but these vessels never saw action . Another proposal , the towed or ' Harvey ' torpedo , involved an explosive on a line or outrigger ; either to deter a ship from ramming or to make a torpedo attack by a boat less suicidal .
The revolutionary forces were to be demobilized as soon as possible and the federal forces were to be the only army in Mexico . This was in order to appease the army , which had opposed a compromise with Madero .
The difficult habitat and retiring nature of the invisible rail mean that information on its lifestyle is sparse , and there are few confirmed sightings . Recorded food items include sago shoots and insects . It also feeds at cut sago plants , although it is unclear whether it is eating the decaying plant or searching for other edible items . It swallows small stones , as do all rails , to help break up its food in the gizzard .
The silicon - directed Nazarov cyclization reaction was subsequently employed in the synthesis of the natural product Silphinene , shown below . The cyclization takes place before elimination of the benzyl alcohol moiety , so that the resulting stereochemistry of the newly formed ring arises from approach of the silyl alkene anti to the ether .
With epoxides and aziridines the reaction serves as a ring - expansion to produce the corresponding oxetane or azetidine . The long reaction times required for these reactions prevent them from occurring as significant side reactions when synthesizing epoxides and aziridines .
On 12 January 2009 , at least three people , including two Mexicans and one American , entered the Parque - Museo La Venta in Villahermosa and damaged just under 30 archaeological pieces , including the four La Venta colossal heads . The vandals were all members of an evangelical church and appeared to have been carrying out a supposed pre - Columbian ritual , during which salts , grape juice and oil were thrown on the heads . It was estimated that 300 , 000 pesos US 21 , 900 would be needed to repair the damage , and the restoration process would last four months . The three vandals were released soon after their arrest after paying 330 , 000 pesos each .
McMaster was followed as chief executive by Matthew Epstein , whose three years in charge 1991 94 were described in a 2006 study by Paul Atkinson as a less happy and less successful period . Epstein was replaced by Anthony Freud , under whom , according to Atkinson , productions became consistently strong , musically well prepared , intelligently staged and well cast . Mackerras was succeeded in 1992 by Carlo Rizzi , who was music director at the time of WNO 's golden jubilee in 1996 . When the occasion was marked with a new production of the Cav and Pag double bill that had launched the company in 1946 , the BBC commented that WNO was one of the most respected opera companies in the world . In The Observer , Michael Ratcliffe called the company the most popular , populist and consistently successful arts organisation ever to come out of Wales ... with the loyalty and affection of audiences in Cardiff and across England ' The people 's opera ' is not a myth . It happened here . The jubilee celebrations were overshadowed by the collapse of a plan for a purpose - built home for the company , the Cardiff Bay Opera House .
Capital punishment was a major issue that was debated in the state during Brigg 's tenure , with social reformers calling for its abolition . Briggs personally favored capital punishment , but for political reasons called for moderation in its use , seeking , for example , to limit its application in murder cases to those involving first degree murder . After an acquittal in an 1846 murder case where anti - death penalty sentiment was thought to have a role , Briggs , seeking to undercut the anti - death penalty lobby , proposed eliminating the penalty for all crimes except murder , but expressed concern that more such acquittals by sympathetic juries would undermine the connection between crime and punishment .
Australia was a member of the international coalition which contributed military forces to the 1991 Gulf War , deploying a naval task group of two warships , a support ship and a clearance diving team ; in total about 750 personnel . The Australian contribution was the first time Australian personnel were deployed to an active war zone since the establishment of the ADF and the deployment tested its capabilities and command structure . However , the Australian force did not see combat , and instead playing a significant role in enforcing the sanctions put in place against Iraq following the invasion of Kuwait . Some ADF personnel serving on exchange with British and American units did see combat , and a few were later decorated for their actions . Following the war , the Navy regularly deployed a frigate to the Persian Gulf or Red Sea to enforce the trade sanctions which continued to be applied to Iraq . A number of Australian airmen and ground crew posted to or on exchange with US and British air forces subsequently participated in enforcing no - fly zones imposed over Iraq between 1991 and 2003 .
In a November 2011 interview , the Pope discussed for the first time the use of condoms to prevent STD transmission . He said that the use of a condom can be justified in a few individual cases if the purpose is to reduce the risk of an HIV infection . He gave as an example male prostitutes . There was some confusion at first whether the statement applied only to homosexual prostitutes and thus not to heterosexual intercourse at all . However , Federico Lombardi , spokesman for the Vatican , clarified that it applied to heterosexual and transsexual prostitutes , whether male or female , as well . He did , however , also clarify that the Vatican 's principles on sexuality and contraception had not been changed .

Applewhite began to emphasize a strict hierarchy , teaching that his students needed his guidance , as he needed the guidance of the Next Level . Zeller notes that this naturally ensured that there would be no possibility of the group 's continuing if Applewhite were to die . A relationship with Applewhite was said to be the only way to salvation ; he encouraged his followers to see him as Christ . Zeller states that the group 's previous focus on individual choice was replaced with an emphasis on Applewhite 's role as a mediator . Applewhite maintained some aspects of their scientific teachings , but , in the 1980s , the group became more like a religion in its focus on faith and submission to authority .

Like many English football clubs Aston Villa have had several hooligan firms associated with them : Villa Youth , Steamers , Villa Hardcore and the C - Crew , the last mentioned being very active during the 1970s and 1980s . As can be seen across the whole of English football , the hooligan groups have now been marginalised . In 2004 , several Villa firms were involved in a fight with QPR fans outside Villa Park in which a steward died . The main groupings of supporters can now be found in a number of domestic and international supporters ' clubs . This includes the Official Aston Villa Supporters Club which also has many smaller regional and international sections . There were several independent supporters clubs during the reign of Doug Ellis but most of these disbanded after his retirement . The supporter group My Old Man Said formed to stand up for Villa supporter 's rights , as a direct result of Villa supporters ' protest against the club 's appointment of Alex McLeish . The club 's supporters also publish fanzines such as Heroes and Villains and The Holy Trinity .
When the storm moved ashore in Florida , winds reached an estimated 125 mph 201 km h in Jupiter ; these occurred after the eye passed . In West Palm Beach , anemometers measured at least 80 - mile - per - hour 129 km h winds with gusts to 100 mph 161 km h ; barometers ranged from 28 . 64 to 28 . 78 inHg 970 to 975 mb . The storm produced the strongest winds in the city since the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane . Winds were not as strong farther from the center ; 40 to 45 mph 64 to 72 km h winds were observed in Miami to the south , Titusville to the north , and Tampa on the west coast . Fort Pierce estimated peak winds of 80 to 90 mph 129 to 145 km h , and pressures dipped to 29 . 14 inHg 987 mb . Inland , winds near Lake Okeechobee peaked at only 60 mph 97 km h . The hurricane dropped heavy rainfall along its path , peaking at 17 . 8 in 450 mm in Clermont .

The series begins with opening credits that depict traditional Roman myths , such as Romulus and Remus , the city 's foundation mythos . For inspiration , visual effects and design company A52 explored museums , read the script and researched Roman history . They created the opening sequence entirely in - house . VFX artist Kirk Balden said of production , On many projects , you start off with storyboards and everyone has a good idea of what it 's going to look like when it 's completed . This project was very experimental right to the very end . The tone of it is pretty much unlike anything we 've done and most of what any of us here have seen . There 's a lot there that creatively sets the stage for the series .

The church , which is a main location for the film , was substantially set - dressed . Despite having several original medieval wall paintings , the largest addition was the creation of the medieval mural by artist Margot Noyes . To create the impression of an austere country church , Victorian stone flags were replaced with brick pavers for the duration of filming and the original wall paintings covered up . Plastic guttering and other modern additions were covered up or removed . The churchyard had several gravestones added , including the large box tomb which is a focus of several scenes .

Persian agents or Palmyrene traitors : the possibility of a Persian involvement exists but the outcome of the assassination would not have served Shapur without establishing a pro - Persian monarch on the Palmyrene throne . Another possibility would be Palmyrenes dissatisfied with Odaenathus ' reign and the changes of their city 's governmental system .
The relationship between the Sorraia and other breeds remains largely undetermined , as is its relationship to the wild horse subspecies , the Tarpan and the Przewalski 's Horse . The Sorraia originally developed in the southern part of the Iberian peninsula. d 'Andrade hypothesized that the Sorraia would be the ancestor of the Southern Iberian breeds . Morphologically , scientists place the Sorraia as closely related to the Gallego and the Asturcon , but genetic studies using mitochondrial DNA show that the Sorraia forms a cluster that is largely separated from most Iberian breeds . Some evidence links this cluster with Konik and domestic Mongolian horses . At the same time , one of the maternal lineages is shared with the Lusitano . Genetic evidence has not supported an hypothesis that the Sorraia is related to the Barb horse , an African breed introduced to Iberia by the Moors .
Recent research shows that the Mongol forces most probably never reached Pagan . They were held at bay by the Burmese defenses led by commanders Athinkhaya , Yazathingyan and Thihathu , and probably never got closer than 160 km north of Pagan . An inscription dated 16 February 1293 by the three brothers claimed that they defeated the Mongol army . Even if the Mongols did reach Pagan , the damage they inflicted was probably minimal . At any rate , the Mongol army suffered heavy casualties , and retreated north to Tagaung . They remained there as the treaty was now void .
 Mothers of the Disappeared is a song by rock band U2 . It is the eleventh and final track on their 1987 album The Joshua Tree . The song was inspired by lead singer Bono 's experiences in Nicaragua and El Salvador in July 1986 , following U2 's involvement on Amnesty International 's A Conspiracy of Hope tour . He learned of the Madres de Plaza de Mayo , a group of women whose children had been disappeared by the Argentine and Chilean dictatorships . While in Central America , he met members of COMADRES , a similar organization whose children had been disappeared by the government in El Salvador . Bono sympathized with the Madres and COMADRES and wanted to pay tribute to their cause .

A fatal dose has been calculated as 15 caps . Deaths from this fungus A. muscaria have been reported in historical journal articles and newspaper reports , but with modern medical treatment , fatal poisoning from ingesting this mushroom is extremely rare . Many older books list Amanita muscaria as deadly , but this is an error that implies the mushroom is more toxic than it is . The North American Mycological Association has stated there were no reliably documented fatalities from eating this mushroom during the 20th century . The vast majority 90 or more of mushroom poisoning deaths are from eating the greenish to yellowish death cap , A. phalloides or perhaps even one of the several white Amanita species which are known as destroying angels .
The niche image carved on the south wall is an ensemble of divinities assembled around the central figures of Shiva and Parvati shown getting married Kalyanasundara icon . Parvati is seen standing to Shiva 's right , the ordained place for a Hindu bride at the wedding . The carvings are substantially damaged ; only one of Shiva 's four hands is fully seen and the right leg is missing . Shiva has a headdress with a shining disc attached to it . His garments are well - draped , and well - tied at the waist . The sacred thread is seen across his chest . Parvati is carved as a perfect figure with coiffured hair dress , well adorned with jewellery and is draped tightly to display depressions below the waist only . She is seen with a coy expression and is led by her father who has his right hand on her shoulder . Even though both her hands are damaged , it is inferred that her left hand clasped Shiva 's right hand as a mark of holy alliance . Brahma is sitting as the officiating priest for the marriage . Vishnu is witness to the marriage . Mena , the mother of Parvati , is seen standing next to Vishnu . The moon - god Chandra , seen with a wig and a crescent , is standing behind Parvati holding a circular pot with nectar for the marriage ceremony . Just above the main images , a galaxy of divinities , bearded sages , apsaras nymphs , Vidyadharas , Yakshis , Gandharvas , Bhringi , and other male and female attendants are seen as witness to the marriage ceremony showering flowers on the divine couple .
The common starling appears to have arrived in Fiji in 1925 on Ono - i - lau and Vatoa islands . It may have colonised from New Zealand via Raoul in the Kermadec Islands where it is abundant , that group being roughly equidistant between New Zealand and Fiji . Its spread in Fiji has been limited , and there are doubts about the population 's viability . Tonga was colonised at about the same date and the birds there have been slowly spreading north through the group .

Furthermore , it appears that Iguanodon became more quadrupedal as it got older and heavier ; juvenile I. bernissartensis have shorter arms than adults 60 of hindlimb length versus 70 for adults . When walking as a quadruped , the animal 's hands would have been held so that the palms faced each other , as shown by iguanodontian trackways and the anatomy of this genus 's arms and hands . The three toed pes foot of Iguanodon was relatively long , and when walking , both the hand and the foot would have been used in a digitigrade fashion walking on the fingers and toes . The maximum speed of Iguanodon has been estimated at 24 km h 15 mph , which would have been as a biped ; it would not have been able to gallop as a quadruped .

I had reached a stage in my life that I was getting profoundly sick of not just tired sick . Consequently the public were , likely enough , beginning to agree with me . My rhythm of work had become a bit deadly : a classical or semi - classical film ; a play or two at Stratford , or a nine - month run in the West End , etc etc . I was going mad , desperately searching for something suddenly fresh and thrillingly exciting . What I felt to be my image was boring me to death .
In order to promote the album , Carey embarked on her second head - lining tour . Originally , she had not planned to tour , due to the long travel times and hassle ; however , after many requests from fans , Carey agreed to tour . The tour reached Japan and select European countries , not visiting the United States . This was possibly due to the mixed reception Carey 's 1993 North American Music Box Tour received three years prior . The shows were all spaced apart , giving Carey time to rest her vocals , It 's very strenuous to sing all my songs back to back , but I 'm actually really looking forward to it . Many musicians joined Carey for the tour , including Randy Jackson who served as the musical director and played the bass , Dan Shea on the keyboards , Vernon Black playing the guitar , Gigi Conway on the drums , and percussion and music sequencing by Peter Michael and Gary Cirimelli . All of the musicians and background vocalists were under the supervision of Walter Afanasieff , who played the piano and guided the production . Before embarking on her world tour in 1996 , Carey performed a sold - out show at Madison Square Garden in 1995 . The performance was filmed , and released as a DVD titled Fantasy : Mariah Carey at Madison Square Garden . It became Carey 's fourth video release .

On August 5 , Yankovic recorded Here 's Johnny , a parody of Who 's Johnny by El DeBarge . The song , a loving ode to The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson announcer Ed McMahon , features John Roarke of the television series Fridays fame doing an impression of McMahon 's voice . According to Yankovic , Peter Wolf , the man who wrote Who 's Johnny , enjoyed the parody idea so much that he personally brought the floppy disc program that had all the synthesizer parts for the original song into the studio when Yankovic was recording his parody . The final parody recorded for the album was Toothless People , a play on Mick Jagger 's Ruthless People , which was recorded on August 29 , 1986 . The song , about elderly people who are missing their teeth , was written after Yankovic heard it would be the theme to the 1986 film Ruthless People . Assuming the song would be a hit , Yankovic requested and received permission from Jagger to record a parody version . When Jagger 's song failed to crack the Top 40 , Yankovic considered not recording his version , but because Jagger had authorized the parody , he decided failing to produce it would be an insult to the artist . Therefore , he recorded the spoof anyway .

We can only survive by taking persistent action at strategic points against American imperialism in all its attractive guises . His anti - Americanism influenced some younger scholars , including Donald Creighton .
Another noticeable difference in the storyline takes place when Zhou travels with his teenage disciples to visit his friend the Abbot . Instead of Yue wandering behind the temple to battle the magical snake , he stays with Zhou and the Abbot , while the other disciples go off to explore . Zhou watches as the Abbot tests Yue 's strength by asking him to move an ornate three - hundred pound copper stove dating from the Han Dynasty . The abbot then lifts a stone floor tile and presents the boy with a large book on military strategy . He goes on to tell Yue how he was once a great soldier who fought in campaigns against the Liao and Western Xia empires , but became a monk after the Song agreed to become a vassal of each state . He later made a name for himself by teaching military skills to youths from the surrounding area . Since he has no heir of his own , the Abbot presents Yue with his own personal spear and instructs him in the proper use of the weapon . Zhou kindly protests the gift at first , but allows Yue to keep it out of friendship .
The introduction of the vins de pays , a classification produced under less stringent regulations than those of an AOC , opened up the Languedoc wine industry to the labeling of varietal wines and the blending of international varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon , Merlot , Syrah and Chardonnay . Examples include Vin de pays d 'Oc , Vin de pays d 'Aude , Vin de pays de l 'H rault , and Vin de Pays du Gard . Winemakers such as Guy Anderson , Thierry Boudinaud and E. J. Gallo Winery capitalized on this new horizon , producing wines like FAT bastard and Red Bicyclette .

Later in 1996 , Deal changed the name of the group back to the Breeders , originally with almost the same line - up as the Amps . Until then , Deal had been waiting for Wiggs and Kelley to rejoin the Breeders and record a new album together , and had held back from reforming the Breeders out of respect for them . In May 1996 , Wiggs revealed that she would not be involved in any immediate Breeders activity ; Kelley also chose to stay in Saint Paul , to be close to her rehabilitation facility . Deal then decided that she did not want to wait any longer to reform the group , partly because the Breeders ' repertoire was larger than the Amps ' , thereby allowing longer concerts . Deal added violinist Carrie Bradley who had played on the Breeders ' Pod album , and with Macpherson , Lerma , and Farley , played some shows in 1996 with Primus .

In the early 1980s , Mosley represented FOCA in the FISA - FOCA War , a conflict between FOCA , representing the mainly UK - based independent teams , and FISA , which was supported by the grandee constructors owned by road car manufacturers primarily Alfa Romeo , Ferrari and Renault . In 1981 , FOCA announced its own World Federation of Motor Sport and ran the non - championship 1981 South African Grand Prix . The staging of this event , with worldwide television coverage , helped persuade Jean - Marie Balestre , the FISA president , that FISA would have to negotiate a settlement with FOCA . As Mosley has since commented : We were absolutely skint . If Balestre could have held the manufacturer 's support for a little bit longer , the constructors would have been on their knees . The outcome would then have been very different . Mosley helped draw up the Concorde Agreement , a document which resolved the dispute by essentially giving FISA control of the rules and FOCA control of promotion and television rights . The most recent version of the Concorde Agreement expired on 31 December 2007 , and a new one was being discussed , as of 2008 . In 1982 , the year after the first Concorde Agreement was signed , Mosley left his role at FOCA , and Formula One , to work for the Conservative Party .

Hornung 's arguments have greatly influenced other scholars of Egyptian religion , but some still believe that at times the gods were more unified than he allows . Jan Assmann maintains that the notion of a single deity developed slowly through the New Kingdom , beginning with a focus on Amun - Ra as the all - important sun god . In his view , Atenism was an extreme outgrowth of this trend . It equated the single deity with the sun and dismissed all other gods . Then , in the backlash against Atenism , priestly theologians described the universal god in a different way , one that coexisted with traditional polytheism . The one god was believed to transcend the world and all the other deities , while at the same time , the multiple gods were aspects of the one . According to Assmann , this one god was especially equated with Amun , the dominant god in the late New Kingdom , whereas for the rest of Egyptian history the universal deity could be identified with many other gods . James P. Allen says that coexisting notions of one god and many gods would fit well with the multiplicity of approaches in Egyptian thought , as well as with the henotheistic practice of ordinary worshippers . He says that the Egyptians may have recognized the unity of the divine by identifying their uniform notion of ' god ' with a particular god , depending on the particular situation . 
Ireland consists of Old Irish Eriu English land . Eriu derives from Proto - Celtic Iveriu compare Welsh Iwerddon , which is also the source of Latin Hibernia . Iveriu derives from a root meaning fat , prosperous .
The following year , Hakim starred in another Karya - directed film , Kawin Lari Elope . The experience gave her a greater understanding of acting , causing her to see life from a different perspective in studying her character .

Sesuatu yang Indah was the first film in which Hakim used her own voice ; her voice had been dubbed by Titi Qadarsih in previous movies ; Hakim 's own voice had been considered too heavy . The next year , she starred in Badai Pasti Berlalu , appearing on the poster and the cover of the soundtrack album .
Beckham 's ardent support of prohibition likely cost him the election . His position put him at odds with Henry Watterson , editor of the powerful Louisville Courier - Journal . As governor Beckham had crossed the liquor interests and the political machinery in Louisville . When the Kentucky Court of Appeals invalidated the results of Louisville 's municipal elections due to interference by the city 's whiskey ring in May 1907 , Beckham appointed Robert Worth Bingham , a young lawyer and fellow prohibitionist , as interim mayor until elections could be held in November . Bingham eliminated grafting in the police department , closed gambling houses and enforced blue laws closing saloons on Sunday . Following this , the whiskey ring announced Beckham had forfeited the support of Louisville 's legislators . In the senatorial election in 1908 , three of the four Democrats who voted against Beckham were from Louisville . Following his defeat , Beckham returned to his law practice .
 A n economy which emphasizes consumer 's goods is characterized by communication industries largely dependent on advertising and by constant efforts to reach the largest number of readers or listeners ; an economy emphasizing producer 's goods is characterized by communications industries largely dependent on government support . As a result of this contrast , a common public opinion in Russia and the West is hard to achieve .
Paul Gruber from the Erb Institute states that the The Clean Tech Revolution is logically organized and is an excellent resource for those who would like a solid understanding of clean tech and the potential of each sector . He also says that it is very useful for those seeking out the names of companies , NGOs , agencies , and people working on each technology . Gruber identifies one omission : the concern that major investments in clean technology parallel those made during the Internet boom , with the attendant fear that there may be a bubble burst with clean tech .

He joined the Wanderers , the team he had helped to defeat , who played in the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association ECAHA , the successor league to the CAHL as the premier league in the country . He scored eight goals in ten games over the two - month season that lasted from January to March . He helped the team to finish first in the ECAHA and retain the Cup in 1908 with challenges from Ottawa , Winnipeg and Toronto . The Wanderers were Cup champions throughout these challenges , so Ross became the second player to win the Cup with different teams in consecutive years , after Jack Marshall in 1901 and 1902 . In January 1908 , he participated in the first all - star game in sports history , a benefit for the family of former Wanderer defender Hod Stuart , who died the previous summer . Aside from his time with the Wanderers , Ross repeated his practice of playing for other teams who paid for his services in important matches . For the 1909 season Ross demanded a salary of 1 , 600 . Although he settled for 1 , 200 , the average salary of hockey players at the time was 600 . Ross received a cash bonus of 400 to play in a Stanley Cup challenge against a team from Edmonton in December 1908 , in which the Wanderers won the two - game , total - goal series 13 10 . He finished the season with two goals in nine games .

At Kaufmann 's request , Denver artist Allen Tupper True was hired to handle the design and decoration of the walls and floors of the new dam . True 's design scheme incorporated motifs of the Navajo and Pueblo tribes of the region . Although some initially were opposed to these designs , True was given the go - ahead and was officially appointed consulting artist . With the assistance of the National Laboratory of Anthropology , True researched authentic decorative motifs from Indian sand paintings , textiles , baskets and ceramics . The images and colors are based on Native American visions of rain , lightning , water , clouds , and local animals lizards , serpents , birds and on the Southwestern landscape of stepped mesas . In these works , which are integrated into the walkways and interior halls of the dam , True also reflected on the machinery of the operation , making the symbolic patterns appear both ancient and modern .

Thomas Lawton was born on 6 October 1919 to Elizabeth Riley and Thomas Lawton senior in Farnworth , Lancashire . His father was a rail - road signalman of Irish extraction , and his mother worked as a weaver at Harrowby Mill . His father left the family 18 months after Lawton was born , and Elizabeth moved back into her parents ' home in Bolton . Elizabeth 's father , James Hugh Jim Riley , became Lawton 's surrogate father . Lawton 's natural footballing ability earned him a place on the Bolton Town Schools team in 1930 . He was picked by Lancashire Schools at the age of 13 . Despite scoring a hat - trick in a trial game for England Schoolboys , he never earned a full England Schoolboy cap . At the age of 14 he began playing for Hayes Athletic in the Bolton Senior League , and went on to score 570 goals in three seasons . The FA 's rules meant he was unable to turn professional at a club until he was 17 , and Lawton 's grandfather rejected Bolton Wanderers 's offer for Lawton to work as a delivery driver for two years before turning professional at the club . Lawton instead played as an amateur for Rossendale United in the Lancashire Combination , scoring a hat - trick on his debut against Bacup . He took up temporary work at a tannery , and then joined Burnley as assistant groundsman after his mother rejected an offer from Sheffield Wednesday as she objected to him travelling to Sheffield on a daily basis .

Ya ovijaya Ga i , a 17th - century Jain monk , went beyond anek ntav da by advocating madh yastha , meaning standing in the middle or equidistance . This position allowed him to praise qualities in others even though the people were non - Jain and belonged to other faiths . There was a period of stagnation after Yasovijayaji , as there were no new contributions to the development of Jain philosophy .
Members of the group of conspirators watched Turner 's office , home and car , and discussed methods to assassinate him , hoping that his death would hinder the efforts of the federal investigation into Rajneeshpuram . Their plan was to shoot Turner in the garage of the federal office building where he worked , in Portland , Oregon , but the conspirators also debated whether to murder Turner in downtown Portland or closer to his home . After spending multiple nights watching Turner 's house , the conspirators decided on the parking garage because they felt it would be too risky to murder him on the drive to or from work , or in front of his home . Turner had a reserved parking spot in a federal garage underneath Terry Schrunk Plaza in Portland , Oregon . In an affidavit given to the FBI , conspirator Alma Peralta described how the perpetrators decided on the federal parking garage as the location : Shanti Bhadra Catherine Jane Stork said this seems like a good place to bump this fellow off . 
Osbert de Bayeux floruit 1121 to 1184 was a medieval English cleric and archdeacon in the Diocese of York . A relative of Thurstan , the Archbishop of York , Osbert probably owed his ecclesiastical positions to this relative . After Thurstan 's death , Osbert was opposed to one of the candidates for the archbishopric , William fitzHerbert , and worked to secure fitzHerbert 's deposition and replacement by Henry Murdac . After Murdac 's death in 1153 , Osbert tried to prevent the return of fitzHerbert , but these attempts were unsuccessful . When fitzHerbert died suddenly in 1154 , Osbert was accused of murdering the newly returned archbishop . Although he was never convicted of the murder in either a secular or an ecclesiastical court , he was stripped of his clerical status and became a layman before 1158 . He died after 1184 , perhaps even after 1194 .
Prior to her disappearance , according to her friends , Carol was feeling depressed . She had talked of tracing her biological parents , as she was adopted . On 17 July 1976 , she went missing . Gordon claimed that she had left home for another man , and Carol had left their home in Leece twice before . It was for this reason , Gordon claimed , that he did not report her missing for six weeks . Carol was said to time her periods away from home to coincide with the school holidays . Gordon claimed that it wasn 't until she didn 't return in time to take up her job as a primary school teacher in September the start of the school term that he realised that there was a problem . At this time he reported her missing via his solicitor , and her family was informed . On the day she vanished , the family had been due to visit Blackpool on a day trip . However , Carol said she felt unwell and wanted to remain behind in bed . She was never seen alive again by her family . Gordon claimed he returned home to find Carol had left the house , leaving behind her wedding ring , and that there was no sign of a struggle . A missing persons enquiry was launched , but nothing came of it . This missing persons report was subsequently lost , and it was implied by some that it was because both Gordon and a senior police commander who , by the time the article was published , had died involved in the case were freemasons . This was refuted by Sandra Lean , who , in No Smoke , claimed that Gordon had never been a freemason . At the time , police told Gordon that , should a body be found , he would be the main suspect .

Renewed interest in Crusader castles in the 19th century led to the investigation of Krak des Chevaliers , and architectural plans were drawn up . In the late 19th or early 20th century a settlement had been created within the castle , causing damage to its fabric . The 500 inhabitants were moved in 1933 and the castle was given over to the French state , which carried out a program of clearing and restoration . When Syria declared independence in 1946 , it assumed control . Today , a village called al - Husn exists around the castle and has a population of nearly 9 , 000 . Krak des Chevaliers is located approximately 40 kilometres 25 mi west of the city of Homs , close to the border of Lebanon , and is administratively part of the Homs Governorate . Since 2006 , the castles of Krak des Chevaliers and Qal 'at Salah El - Din have been recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site . It was partially damaged in the Syrian civil war from shelling : the full extent of the damage is unknown , but there have been reports of hasty repairs .
Parts of Varanasi are contaminated with industrial chemicals including toxic heavy metal . Studies of wastewater from Varanasi 's sewage treatment plants identify that water 's contamination with metals and the reuse of this water for irrigation as a way that the toxic metals come to be in the plants that people grow for food . One studied example is palak , a popular leafy vegetable which takes up heavy metal when it is in the soil , and which people then eat . Some of the polluting sludge contains minerals which are fertiliser , which could make polluted water attractive to use . Pesticides used in local farming are persistent enough to be spread through the water , to sewer treatment , then back to the farms as wastewater .
The E.F. Young Hotel was built in 1931 . A staple in the African - American business district that developed west of the city 's core , the hotel was one of the only places in the city during the years of segregation where a traveling African American could find a room .
Like most other Proteaceae , Banksia violacea has proteoid roots , roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter . These enhance solubilisation of nutrients , thus allowing their uptake in low - nutrient soils such as the phosphorus - deficient soils of Australia . B. violacea is highly susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback .
The church is in the Mill Creek valley . As tensions with Native Americans were beginning to ease , Lord Fairfax sought to entice white settlers to the sparsely settled lands of his Northern Neck Proprietary . The valley was one of the first parts of present - day Hampshire County to be settled by whites , beginning in the mid - 18th century . Settlers were drawn by the valley 's fertility . As the valley 's population grew , the unincorporated community of Purgitsville developed along Mill Creek as a trading post village ; it was named for Henry Purgitt or Purgate , who acquired 400 acres 160 ha in the Mill Creek valley on January 7 , 1785 , and received a further land transfer of 137 acres 55 ha in 1794 . Purgitsville continued to develop throughout the course of the 19th century , during which time it grew to include a small store , a post office , and a blacksmith shop .

The Church position on sexual activity can be summarized as : sexual activity belongs only in marriage as an expression of total self - giving and union , and always open to the possibility of new life . Sexual acts in marriage are considered noble and honorable and are meant to be enjoyed with joy and gratitude . Sexuality is to be reserved to marriage : by its very nature conjugal love requires the inviolable fidelity of the spouses . This is the consequence of the gift of themselves which they make to each other . Love seeks to be definitive ; it cannot be an arrangement ' until further notice . ' The intimate union of marriage , as a mutual giving of two persons , and the good of the children , demand total fidelity from the spouses and require an unbreakable union between them . Gaudium et spes .

By August 5 , forecasters were discussing the possibility of the storm impacting Hawaii . Residents were advised to ensure that their disaster kits were fully stocked and ready . Governor Linda Lingle made a speech to the state of Hawaii the same day . She emphasized that the storm was not an imminent threat but that residents should be ready and should know where the nearest emergency shelter is . Since forecasters expected the storm to weaken before it reached the islands , only minor effects mainly rainfall were expected . Hawaii County mayor Billy Kenoi was also briefed on the approaching storm and he advised the county to be prepared . Stores reported an influx of shoppers and posted anniversary sales . Blue tarps for roofs were being sold at 1 apiece . The American Red Cross also reported that sales of the water bob , a water container that can be attached to a bathtub and hold roughly 100 gallons of water , increased significantly . On August 6 , the Red Cross stated that it was deploying a disaster recovery team , led by the director of the agency , to the islands of Hawaii .
In their 1998 book , Star Trek 101 , Terry J. Erdmann and Paula M. Block called Unnatural Selection the key Pulaski episode . Science fiction writer Keith DeCandido felt that she displays all of her worst traits in this episode , including her stubbornness , her intensity , her constant interrupting of people , her bitching out Data though at least this time she apologizes to him when he expresses concern over her health , and ... transporter - phobia , because apparently she wasn 't enough like Dr. McCoy yet . DeCandido described Pulaski as annoying and noted that this feeling was mirrored on screen by Captain Picard . In Science Fiction Television : A History , author M. Keith Booker observed that Pulaski never quite meshed with the rest of the crew .
The NDH authorities in Trebinje heard rumours that the Serbs could start an uprising there on 28 June , the feast day of Saint Vitus , and warned NDH forces in the region to be prepared for a revolt . As a result of these reports , the Poglavnik leader of the NDH , Ante Paveli , issued orders threatening that anyone who spread these rumours would be court - martialled . On the eve of the feast day , both the gendarmerie and Usta e took several hostages in case the rumours were true . Later , the gendarmerie released their hostages , but the 19 hostages held by the Usta e were killed . In contrast to the actions of the Usta e , the Home Guard units in the area tried to calm the situation down .
On 25 June 1950 , the North Korean Army KPA crossed the border into South Korea and advanced for the capital Seoul , which fell in less than a week . North Korean forces continued toward the port of Pusan and two days later the United States offered its assistance to South Korea . In response the United Nations Security Council requested members to assist in repelling the North Korean attack . Australia initially contributed P - 51 Mustang fighter - bomber aircraft from No. 77 Squadron RAAF and infantry from the 3rd Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment 3 RAR , both of which were stationed in Japan as part of the BCOF . In addition , it provided the majority of supply and support personnel to the British Commonwealth Forces Korea . The RAN frigate HMAS Shoalhaven , and the destroyer HMAS Bataan , were also committed . Later , an aircraft carrier strike group aboard HMAS Sydney was added to the force .

The athletics competition at the first Olympics featured a men 's long jump competition and a women 's competition was introduced at the 1948 Summer Olympics . Professional long jumpers typically have strong acceleration and sprinting abilities . However , athletes must also have a consistent stride to allow them to take off near the board while still maintaining their maximum speed . In addition to the traditional long jump , a standing long jump contest exists which requires that athletes leap from a static position without a run - up . A men 's version of this event featured on the Olympic programme from 1900 to 1912 .
The C SF established 470 , 000 acres 1 , 900 km2 for the Everglades Agricultural Area 27 percent of the Everglades before development . In the late 1920s , agricultural experiments indicated that adding large amounts of manganese sulfate to Everglades muck produced profitable vegetable harvests . Adding 100 pounds 45 kg of the compound was more cost effective than adding 1 short ton 0 . 91 t of manure . The primary cash crop in the EAA is sugarcane , though sod , beans , lettuce , celery , and rice are also grown . Sugarcane became more consolidated an industry than did any other crop ; in 1940 the coalition of farms was renamed U.S. Sugar and this produced 86 percent of Everglades sugar . During the 1930s the sugarcane farmers ' coalition came under investigation for labor practices that bordered on slavery . Potential employees primarily young black men were lured from all over the U.S. by the promise of jobs , but they were held financially responsible for training , transportation , room and board and other costs . Quitting while debts were owed was punishable with jail time . By 1942 , U.S. Sugar was indicted for peonage in federal court , though the charges were eventually dismissed on a technicality . U.S. Sugar benefited significantly from the U.S. embargo on Cuban goods beginning in the early 1960s . In 1958 , before the Castro regime , 47 , 000 acres 190 km2 of sugarcane were harvested in Florida ; by the 1964 1965 season , 228 , 000 acres 920 km2 were harvested . From 1959 to 1962 the region went from two sugar mills to six , one of which in Belle Glade set several world records for sugar production .
Manila has six representative districts for the lower house of the Philippine Congress . Furthermore , the city is composed of 16 districts , namely : Binondo , Ermita , Intramuros , Malate , Paco , Pandacan , Port Area , Quiapo , Sampaloc , San Andres , San Miguel , San Nicolas , Santa Ana , Santa Cruz , Santa Mesa and Tondo .
Burial 10 is the tomb of Yax Nuun Ayiin . It is located beneath Structure 34 in the North Acropolis . The tomb contained a rich array of offerings , including ceramic vessels and food , and nine youths were sacrificed to accompany the dead king . A dog was also entombed with the deceased king . Pots in the tomb were stuccoed and painted and many demonstrated a blend of Maya and Teotihuacan styles . Among the offerings was an incense - burner in the shape of an elderly underworld god , sitting on a stool made of human bones and holding a severed head in his hands . The tomb was sealed with a corbel vault , then the pyramid was built on top .
NY 38A 21 . 91 miles or 35 . 26 kilometres runs from Moravia to NY 359 , near Mandana and NY 41A in southwestern Onondaga County , and then towards Auburn . It was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York .
As part of the Good Friday Agreement , the British and Irish governments agreed on the creation of all - island institutions and areas of cooperation .
This was followed by a lengthy nine - issue story arc , The Fear Machine , revolving around a masonic plot to collect people 's fears , in order to resurrect a Cthulhian god known as Juntakillokian , and his efforts to prevent this with the help of environmentalists , including Mercury , a young psychic girl , and Marj , her mother , with whom he becomes romantically involved . The penultimate major run of Delano 's tenure was The Family Man , which differed from the main body of the series thus far in that Constantine 's nemesis is not supernatural beyond an opening metafictional encounter with a fictional fence , but a former policeman turned serial killer . John 's ethical quandary as to whether murder is ever acceptable , and his coping with the murder of his father , Thomas , frames this story . During this run on the title , Grant Morrison issues 25 26 and Neil Gaiman issue 27 both filled in during a three - month break , Grant Morrison 's story dealing with nuclear fear , and Neil Gaiman 's being a simple romantic ghost story .
When Bacon undertook the series late in 1948 he was something of a two - hit wonder . He had success in 1944 with Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion and to a lesser extent with Painting 1946 , both of which were highly regarded but viewed as sensationalist . The exhibition was a success , and marked his critical breakthrough . Until then , he had been highly regarded but capable of only occasional brilliance . The full show established him in the minds of critics as , according to Michael Peppiatt , more of a force to be reckoned with in the contemporary scene . While some found his images horrifying and unnerving , they wrote about him all the same , sealing his reputation as the enfant terrible of post - war British art . The critic for The Observer wrote , The recent paintings ... horrifying as they are , cannot be ignored . Technically they are superb , and the masterly handling of large areas of pearly grey , flushed with a sudden pink or green , only makes me regret the more that the artist 's gift should have been brought to subjects so esoteric .
John then went to France , although Philip II was annoyed at being excluded from the decision of Isabella 's marriage . Matilda I , Countess of Nevers , Erard II of Chacenay , Albert , Abbot of Vauluisant and other local potentates asked John to intervene in their conflicts , indicating that he was esteemed in his homeland . John attended the funeral of Philip II at the Basilica of St Denis in July ; Philip bequeathed more than 150 , 000 marks for the defence of the Holy Land . John then visited England , attempting to mediate a peace treaty between England and France after his return to France .
Lesnar continued to aggressively pursue the WWE title despite his friendship with Angle . Mr. McMahon found his way into the angle , at first berating Lesnar , who had involved himself in McMahon 's rivalry with Zach Gowen , for losing to Angle . This all turned out to be a swerve that came into focus on the August 7 , 2003 SmackDown ! in Kelowna , British Columbia . That night , Lesnar and McMahon were to face each other in a steel cage match with Angle as the special guest referee as per McMahon 's orders on the previous week 's program . During the match , Lesnar had passed out due to a staged backstage incident and McMahon was set to pin him , but Angle refused to allow McMahon to win that way . As the two men began to argue , Lesnar rose to his feet , revealing the ruse to the crowd , and F - 5'd Angle . He then brutally beat Angle while McMahon watched , and celebrated with him afterwards , turning heel in the process . At SummerSlam , Lesnar lost to Angle when Angle made Lesnar tap out to the ankle lock . After that , Lesnar would cement his heel turn by brutalizing smaller wrestlers and attacking his rivals on a more consistent basis . He returned to using the F - 5 to propel his opponents ' legs into the ringpost , as he did to Spanky and Gowen , and interfered in Angle 's matches on two separate occasions . On the September 18 , 2003 episode of SmackDown ! , Lesnar received his third shot at Angle in as many months when he faced the champion in a sixty - minute Iron Man match for the title . Lesnar won the match and his third WWE Championship by a final count of five to four .
Perfect Dark was ported by 4J Studios , the same studio that previously developed the Xbox Live Arcade versions of Rare 's platform games Banjo - Kazooie and Banjo - Tooie . According to Microsoft Game Studios creative director Ken Lobb , the development team took the original code , ported it to the Xbox 360 and included deep Xbox Live integration . The game was developed over a course of approximately 11 months after the creation of a working prototype . As the Xbox Live functionality had to be written from scratch , the developers opted to completely rewrite the game engine rather than do a port through emulation . As a result , although the game plays exactly the same , the code and renderer is different . The game also runs at 1080p and 60 frames per second .
During his final years , Wheeler remained involved in various activities , for instance sitting on the advisory panel of the Antiquity journal and the Management Committee of the Royal Archaeological Institute . In March 1971 , the archaeologist Barry Cunliffe and a number of his undergraduate students at the University of Southampton organised a conference on the subject of The Iron Age and its Hillforts to celebrate Wheeler 's eightieth birthday . Wheeler attended the event , whose conference proceedings were published as a festschrift for the octogenarian . In spring 1973 , Wheeler returned to BBC television for two episodes of the archaeology - themed series Chronicle in which he discussed his life and career . The episodes were well received , and Wheeler became a close friend of the show 's producer , David Collison .
Alkan 's later correspondence contains many despairing comments . In a letter of about 1861 he wrote to Hiller : I 'm becoming daily more and more misanthropic and misogynous ... nothing worthwhile , good or useful to do ... no one to devote myself to . My situation makes me horridly sad and wretched . Even musical production has lost its attraction for me for I can 't see the point or goal . This spirit of anomie may have led him to reject requests in the 1860s to play in public , or to allow performances of his orchestral compositions . However , it should not be ignored that he was writing similarly frantic self - analyses in his letters of the early 1830s to Masarnau .
From the 11th - century limb - flowery , limb - arrowy and limb - spotty decorative forms of Asomtavruli are developed . The first two are found in 11th- and 12th - century monuments , whereas the third one is used until the 18th century .
Mycena maculata bears some resemblance to M. inclinata , but is only associated with decaying hardwood logs and stumps , and is found in eastern North America , and sometimes on oak on the West Coast . In age , it develops reddish spots on the gills that are not seen in M. inclinata . M. inclinata is often confused with the edible M. galericulata , a common species that is variable in cap color , size and shape . M. galericulata typically has a bluntly conical cap that is dull gray - brown , and white to grayish veins that have numerous cross - veins . M. polygramma has a ridged stem that is bluish - gray .
Vertical jumps high jump and pole vault set a bar at a particular height . The competitor must clear the bar without knocking it off the standards that are holding the bar flat . Three failures in a row ends the competitor 's participation in the event . The competitor has the option to PASS their attempt , which can be used to strategic advantage of course that advantage is lost if the competitor misses . A pass could be used to save energy and avoid taking a jump that would not improve their position in the standings . After all competitors have either cleared , passed or failed their attempts at a height , the bar goes up . The amount the bar goes up is predetermined before the competition , though when one competitor remains , that competitor may choose their own heights for the remaining attempts . A record is kept of each attempt by each competitor . After all competitors have taken their attempts , the one jumping the highest is the winner , and so on down the other competitors in the event . Ties are broken by first , the number of attempts taken at the highest height fewest wins , and then if still tied , by the total number of misses in the competition as a whole . The bar does not go back to a lower height except to break a tie for first place or a qualifying position . If those critical positions are still tied after applying the tiebreakers , all tied competitors take a fourth jump at the last height . If they still miss , the bar goes down one increment where they again jump . This process continues until the tie is broken .
Banai does not appear in the Malhari Mahatmya originating from the Brahmin high - priest caste tradition , which glorifies Khandoba as Shiva and de - emphasizes his earthly connections . In contrast , Banai occupies the central position in the Dhangar folk narrative and Mhalsa 's marriage to Khandoba is reduced to a passing mention ; Marathas and other settled castes give more importance to Mhalsa .
The science of stellar spectroscopy was pioneered by Joseph von Fraunhofer and Angelo Secchi . By comparing the spectra of stars such as Sirius to the Sun , they found differences in the strength and number of their absorption lines the dark lines in a stellar spectra caused by the atmosphere 's absorption of specific frequencies . In 1865 Secchi began classifying stars into spectral types . However , the modern version of the stellar classification scheme was developed by Annie J. Cannon during the 1900s .
Van Morrison : Too Late to Stop Now is a biography of musician Van Morrison , written by Steve Turner . It was first published in 1993 in the United States by Penguin Group , and in Great Britain by Bloomsbury Publishing . Turner first met Van Morrison in 1985 ; he interviewed approximately 40 people that knew the subject in his research for the biography . Van Morrison did not think positively of the biography , and multiple newspapers reported he attempted to purchase all of the book 's 25 , 000 copies . He sent a letter to the author asserting the 40 individuals interviewed for the book were not his friends , and accused Turner of peddling distortions and inaccuracies about me personally .
Ace Attorney Investigations 2 is the second entry in the Investigations series . It was released for the Nintendo DS in 2011 in Japan , but has not been released in the West .
In 2007 , the widow of Officer Faulkner coauthored a book with Philadelphia radio journalist Michael Smerconish entitled Murdered by Mumia : A Life Sentence of Pain , Loss , and Injustice . The book was part memoir of Faulkner 's widow , part discussion in which they chronicled Abu - Jamal 's trial and discussed evidence for his conviction , and part discussion on supporting the death penalty . J. Patrick O 'Connor , editor and publisher of crimemagazine.com , argues in his book The Framing of Mumia Abu - Jamal that the preponderance of evidence establishes that it was not Abu - Jamal but a passenger in Abu - Jamal 's brother 's car , Kenneth Freeman , who killed Faulkner , and that the Philadelphia Police Department and District Attorney 's Office framed Abu - Jamal . His book was criticized in the American Thinker as replete with selective use of testimony , distortions , unsubstantiated charges , and a theory that has failed Abu - Jamal in the past . 
The former - Portuguese colony of East Timor was invaded by Indonesia in 1975 , however , following years of violent struggle the new Indonesian government of President B.J. Habibie subsequently agreed to allow the East Timorese to vote on autonomy in 1999 . The United Nations Mission in East Timor UNAMET was established to organise and conduct the vote , which was held at the end of August 1999 and resulted with 78 . 5 of voters deciding in favour of independence . However , following the announcement of the results pro - Indonesian militias supported by elements of the Indonesian military , launched a campaign of violence , looting and arson and many East Timorese were killed , while perhaps more than 500 , 000 were displaced . Unable to control the violence , Indonesia subsequently agreed to the deployment of a multinational peacekeeping force . Australia , which had contributed police to UNAMET , organised and led an international military coalition , known as the International Force for East Timor INTERFET , a non - UN force operating in accordance with UN resolutions . The total size of the Australian force committed numbered 5 , 500 personnel , and included a significant ground force , supported by air and naval forces , in the largest single deployment of Australian forces since 1945 .
The Importance of Being Earnest has been revived many times since its premiere . It has been adapted for the cinema on three occasions . In The Importance of Being Earnest 1952 , Dame Edith Evans reprised her celebrated interpretation of Lady Bracknell ; The Importance of Being Earnest 1992 by Kurt Baker used an all - black cast ; and Oliver Parker 's The Importance of Being Earnest 2002 incorporated some of Wilde 's original material cut during the preparation of the original stage production .
Abraham Henthorn Stott , the son of a stonemason , was born in nearby Shaw and Crompton in 1822 . He served a seven - year apprenticeship with Sir Charles Barry , before starting a structural engineering practice in Oldham in 1847 that went on to become the pre - eminent mill architect firm in Lancashire . Philip Sydney Stott , third son of Abraham and later titled as Sir Philip Stott , 1st Baronet , was the most prominent and famous of the Stott mill architects . He established his own practice in 1883 and designed over a hundred mills in several countries . His factories , which improved upon his father 's fireproof mills , accounted for a 40 increase in Oldham 's spindles between 1887 and 1914 .
An important goal of AI research is to allow computers to communicate in natural languages like English . An early success was Daniel Bobrow 's program STUDENT , which could solve high school algebra word problems .
In October 1941 , the newly installed mayor of Zagreb , Ivan Werner , issued a decree ordering the demolition of the Pra ka Street synagogue , ostensibly because it did not fit into the city 's master plan . The demolition began on October 10 , 1941 , proceeding slowly so as not to damage the adjacent buildings ; it was finished by April 1942 . The whole process was photographed for propaganda purposes , and the photographs were shown to the public at an antisemitic exhibition first held in Zagreb . It was also shown in Dubrovnik , Karlovac , Sarajevo , Vukovar and Zemun , as an illustration of the solution of the Jewish question in Croatia .

In Australia , the song debuted and peaked at four .
Nonoxynol - 9 was once believed to offer additional protection against STDs including HIV but recent studies have shown that , with frequent use , nonoxynol - 9 may increase the risk of HIV transmission . The World Health Organization says that spermicidally lubricated condoms should no longer be promoted . However , it recommends using a nonoxynol - 9 lubricated condom over no condom at all . As of 2005 , nine condom manufacturers have stopped manufacturing condoms with nonoxynol - 9 and Planned Parenthood has discontinued the distribution of condoms so lubricated .
NY 93 begins at an intersection with NY 18F Main Street ; co - designated but not signed as County Route 907 or CR 907 in the center of the village of Youngstown . The route proceeds eastward through the village as a two - lane road named Lockport Street , serving two blocks of commercial areas before bending to the northeast and passing into the residential eastern portion of Youngstown . At the eastern village limits , NY 93 briefly widens to four lanes as it enters a partial cloverleaf interchange with the Niagara Scenic Parkway . Past the junction , the highway reverts to a two - lane road and changes names to Youngstown Lockport Road as it runs across the town of Porter . The residential surroundings continue to the hamlet of Towers Corners , where NY 93 connects to NY 18 Creek Road .
He was elected emperor in 1229 as the senior co - ruler with Baldwin II of the Latin Empire , and was crowned in Constantinople in 1231 . John III Vatatzes , Emperor of Nicaea , and Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria occupied the last Latin territories in Thrace and Asia Minor , besieging Constantinople in early 1235 .

On July 21 , 2006 , a judge in Cook County , Illinois , determined that Jordan did not owe his alleged former lover Karla Knafel 5 million in a breach of contract claim . Jordan had allegedly paid Knafel 250 , 000 to keep their relationship a secret . Knafel claimed Jordan promised her 5 million for remaining silent and agreeing not to file a paternity suit after Knafel learned she was pregnant in 1991 . A DNA test showed Jordan was not the father of the child .
The Romanian Land Forces Romanian : For ele Terestre Rom ne is the army of Romania , and the main component of the Romanian Armed Forces . In recent years , full professionalisation and a major equipment overhaul have transformed the nature of the force .
Soviet armor plate plants proved incapable of producing plates of cemented armor thicker than 230 mm 9 . 1 in which forced the decision to replace cemented plates thicker than 200 mm 7 . 9 in with face - hardened ones with less resistance in November 1940 . The plants tended to compensate by making the thicker plates harder , but this often made them more brittle and large numbers did not pass the acceptance tests . This would have significantly reduced the level of protection enjoyed by the Sovetsky Soyuz - class ships in combat .

Character designs were created by Mutsumi Inomata . A key element of the designs was the variation of time periods many characters came from . To make the character sprites as close as possible to the original artwork , the team took Inomata 's artwork and turned them into 2D dot - by - dot sprite pictures . This gave the sprites roughly four times the detail of most environments . They then built the world around the sprites . The sprite details sometimes caused problems , as they would appear larger than the environments when the camera zoomed in . The animated cutscenes were created by anime company Production I.G. The game 's opening was the longest ever created for a Tales game up to that point . While many contemporary PS2 role - playing games were being developed around three - dimensional characters , Destiny 2 used two - dimensional sprites for its characters . Part of the reason behind this was that the development team wanted to create the ultimate 2D RPG . As opposed to previous Tales games , where gameplay development was focused on the battle system , the development leads requested that the gameplay should be waste - free and strategic . The Grade system and new skill customizing elements , later staples of the series , were also developed . The game 's artificial intelligence was markedly improved , the combat system was made both more elaborate and more user - friendly , and health and magic systems were adjusted . The PlayStation 2 hardware enabled the expansion of mini - games , the improvement of the game 's graphics , and the incorporation of advanced interactive elements on the world map .
Of Human Feelings explores jazz - funk music and continues Coleman 's harmolodic approach to improvisation with Prime Time , whom he introduced on his 1975 album Dancing in Your Head . He drew on rhythm and blues influences from early in his career for Of Human Feelings , which had shorter and more distinct compositions than Dancing in Your Head . Coleman also applied free jazz principles from his music during the 1960s to elements of funk .
Through contact with neighboring civilizations , the Egyptians also adopted foreign deities . Dedun , who is first mentioned in the Old Kingdom , may have come from Nubia , and Baal , Anat , and Astarte , among others , were adopted from Canaanite religion during the New Kingdom c . 1550 1070 BC . In Greek and Roman times , from 332 BC to the early centuries AD , deities from across the Mediterranean world were revered in Egypt , but the native gods remained , and they often absorbed the cults of these newcomers into their own worship .

In the fall of 1944 , Rifenburg enrolled at the University of Michigan . The United Press syndicate ran a feature article about Rifenburg in September 1944 that opened as follows : Another great end has made his appearance on the Big Ten football horizon in the person of Dick Rifenburg , 18 - year - old Michigan freshman . Every so often a great offensive end comes along , a player who has to learn how to play defense , but who has the natural speed , smooth actions , height and big hands that is the mark of an outstanding pass receiver . Rifenburg has laid claim to that rating . A loose - limbed 180 - pound freshman from Saginaw , Mich . , Rifenberg is being boomed as the Big Ten 's next ' freshman sensation . ' As a freshman , he caught two touchdown passes in his first college football game against Iowa .

On 9 June , Restigouche was ordered to Le Havre , France to evacuate British troops , but none were to be found and the ship investigated the small port of Saint - Valery - en - Caux some 40 miles 64 km northeast of Le Havre on 11 June . They found some elements of the 51st Infantry Division , but had not received any orders to evacuate and refused to do so . Whilst recovering her landing party , the ship was taken under fire by a German artillery battery , but she was not hit and returned fire . After returning to England , Restigouche escorted several troop convoys on the last legs of their journeys from Canada , Australia and New Zealand in mid - June . On 23 June , the ship escorted the ocean liner SS Arandora Star to St. Jean de Luz to evacuate Polish troops and British refugees trapped by the German Army in south - western France Operation Ariel . On 25 June 1940 , Restigouche , her sister HMCS Fraser , and the light cruiser HMS Calcutta were returning from St. Jean de Luz when Fraser was rammed by Calcutta in the Gironde estuary at night .

All but 47 of the ship 's crew and evacuees were rescued by Restigouche and other nearby ships . The rear portion had to be sunk by Restigouche .
Jordan 's marked talent was clear from his rookie season . In his first game in Madison Square Garden against the New York Knicks , Jordan received a prolonged standing ovation , a rarity for an opposing player . After Jordan scored a playoff record 63 points against the Boston Celtics on April 20 , 1986 , Celtics star Larry Bird described him as God disguised as Michael Jordan . 
Another potential Guitar Hero project was discovered by the archival site Unseen64 for a game titled Hero World , a massively multiplayer online game that would link the Guitar Hero and DJ Hero games . The game had been developed by FreeStyle Games , sometime after the release of DJ Hero 2 , with the main development duties passed to Virtual Fairground , using their platform The Ride , an Adobe Flash - based platform that would let the game be played in a web browser . The game was cancelled in 2011 along with other pending Guitar Hero projects .

Olivier and Esmond married on 25 July 1930 at All Saints , Margaret Street , although within weeks both realised they had erred . Olivier later recorded that the marriage was a pretty crass mistake . I insisted on getting married from a pathetic mixture of religious and animal promptings . ... She had admitted to me that she was in love elsewhere and could never love me as completely as I would wish . Olivier later recounted that following the wedding he did not keep a diary for ten years and never followed religious practices again , although he considered those facts to be mere coincidence , unconnected to the nuptials .
Plume harvesting became a dangerous business . The Audubon Society became concerned with the amount of hunting being done in rookeries in the mangrove forests . In 1902 , they hired a warden , Guy Bradley , to watch the rookeries around Cuthbert Lake . Bradley had lived in Flamingo within the Everglades , and was murdered in 1905 by one of his neighbors after he tried to prevent him from hunting . Protection of birds was the reason for establishing the first wildlife refuge when President Theodore Roosevelt set Pelican Island as a sanctuary in 1903 .
Reviewing the 2003 Slayer box set Soundtrack to the Apocalypse , Adrien Begrand of PopMatters described the album as their most underrated , and on this set , its five selections show how highly the band thinks of the record . KNAC.com 's Peter Atkinson was also positive , saying the album has a grandiosity and imposing presence which makes the record so magnificent . Grave 's Ola Lindgren and Bolt Thrower 's Karl Willetts both rate South of Heaven as amongst the top five albums of all time , while Max Kolesne of Brazilian death metal group Krisiun remembers hearing the song Silent Scream for the first time : It just blew me away . It was like fast double - bass , fast kicks during the whole song . That was very inspiring for me . When discussing Slayer in an October 2007 interview , Evile frontman Matt Drake stated that while Reign in Blood was just speed , South of Heaven proved that the group could write slow material as well . Metal Forces reviewer gives the band credit for at least making an effort to try something new and not being afraid to experiment at such a crucial stage of their career , creating one of the more original sounding thrash speed metal albums he heard in a long while . He remarks , however , that if you re expecting to hear Reign in Blood Part Two , you ll be in for a major disappointment .
Federer won two more events , the first at the Madrid Masters over Nadal on clay . The second was in Cincinnati over Novak Djokovic .
In his major theoretical statement , ' Opera and Drama ' 1852 , Wagner objected to the music of Meyerbeer , asserting its superficiality and incoherence in dramatic terms ; this work contains Wagner 's well - known put - down of Meyerbeer 's operas as ' effects without causes ' . It also contains the sardonic crack that ' Rossini never could have dreamt that it would some day occur to the Bankers , for whom he had always made their music , to make it for themselves ' . ' Jewishness in Music ' was reissued in 1869 , after Meyerbeer 's death in an extended form , with a far more explicit attack on Meyerbeer . This version was under Wagner 's own name and as Wagner had by now a far greater reputation , his views obtained far wider publicity . These attacks on Meyerbeer which also included swipes at Felix Mendelssohn are regarded by Paul Lawrence Rose as a significant milestone in the growth of German anti - Semitism .

The second half was played very closely , with neither team taking a substantial lead . With 3 : 16 to play , Duke took a 60 55 lead on two made free throws by Nolan Smith . Butler cut the lead to one point in the final minute and , after a missed Kyle Singler jump shot with 36 seconds remaining , got a chance to retake the lead . Butler was unable to initiate their offense and Stevens called a timeout to set up a play . A failed inbounds attempt and a timeout later , Hayward missed a baseline fade - away jumper and Brian Zoubek came down with the rebound for Duke . He was quickly fouled with less than 4 seconds remaining . Hayward narrowly missed a desperation half - court shot court as time expired , making the final margin 61 59 .
Elvis might never have been born , but someone else would surely have brought the world rock ' n ' roll . No such logic accounts for Bob Dylan . No iron law of history demanded that a would - be Elvis from Hibbing , Minnesota , would swerve through the Greenwich Village folk revival to become the world 's first and greatest rock ' n ' roll beatnik bard and then having achieved fame and adoration beyond reckoning vanish into a folk tradition of his own making .

The Wisteria Lane set , which is located on the Colonial Street backlot set at Universal Studios , underwent changes for the time jump . Production designer P. Erik Carlson explained , former production designer Thomas A. Walsh had already created a fairly Utopian world , and we wanted to exaggerate and enhance it a little bit more , mostly through the use of color . We didn t want it to feel ridiculously futuristic or viewers would be jarred by the contrast . Bree 's garage was remodeled into a testing kitchen as result of the character 's catering business . Additionally , all houses were repainted with bolder colors , with the exception of Gabrielle 's home , in order to reflect the Solis ' financial situation .

The nuclear lamina is composed mostly of lamin proteins . Like all proteins , lamins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and later transported to the nucleus interior , where they are assembled before being incorporated into the existing network of nuclear lamina . Lamins found on the cytosolic face of the membrane , such as emerin and nesprin , bind to the cytoskeleton to provide structural support . Lamins are also found inside the nucleoplasm where they form another regular structure , known as the nucleoplasmic veil , that is visible using fluorescence microscopy . The actual function of the veil is not clear , although it is excluded from the nucleolus and is present during interphase . Lamin structures that make up the veil , such as LEM3 , bind chromatin and disrupting their structure inhibits transcription of protein - coding genes .

Excavations at the quarry were stopped in 1881 , although it was not exhausted of fossils , as recent drilling operations have shown . During World War I , when the town was occupied by German forces , preparations were made to reopen the mine for palaeontology , and Otto Jaekel was sent from Berlin to supervise . The Allies recaptured Bernissart just as the first fossiliferous layer was about to be uncovered . Further attempts to reopen the mine were hindered by financial problems and were stopped altogether in 1921 when the mine flooded .
There were different interpretations of the popular mourning of Eva Per n 's death . Some reporters viewed the mourning as authentic , others saw a public succumbing to another of the passion plays of the Peronist regime . Time magazine reported that the Peronist government enforced the observance of a daily period of five minutes of mourning following a daily radio announcement .
When it was reported , Protomycena electra was the third species of fossil agaric fungus to be described . The two species Coprinites dominicana and Aureofungus yaniguaensis are also known from the amber mines of the Dominican Republic , while the fourth species Archaeomarasmius leggeti is from the older , Cretaceous age New Jersey Amber . With the 2007 publication of a fifth extinct agaric species , Palaeoagaracites antiquus , the minimum age for the Agaricales order was pushed back to the Albian approximately 100 Ma .
Wheeler was impatient to start excavations , and in July 1921 started a six - week project to excavate at the Roman fort of Segontium ; accompanied by his wife , he used up his holiday to oversee the project . A second season of excavation at the site followed in 1922 . Greatly influenced by the writings of the archaeologist Augustus Pitt - Rivers , Wheeler emphasised the need for a strong , developed methodology when undertaking an archaeological excavation , believing in the need for strategic planning , or what he termed controlled discovery , with clear objectives in mind for a project . Further emphasising the importance of prompt publication of research results , he wrote full seasonal reports for Archaeologia Cambrensis before publishing a full report , Segontium and the Roman Occupation of Wales . Wheeler was keen on training new generations of archaeologists , and two of the most prominent students to excavate with him at Segontium were Victor Nash - Williams and Ian Richmond .
Focusing on the quality of the poem , Stuart Sperry , argued in 1973 , ' Ode to a Nightingale ' is the supreme expression in all Keats 's poetry of the impulse to imaginative escape that flies in the face of the knowledge of human limitation , the impulse fully expressed in ' Away ! away ! for I will fly to thee . ' Wolf Hirst , in 1981 , described the poem as justly celebrated and claimed that Since this movement into an eternal realm of song is one of the most magnificent in literature , the poet 's return to actuality is all the more shattering . Helen Vendler continued the earlier view that the poem was artificial but added that the poem was an attempt to be aesthetic and spontaneous that was later dropped . In 1983 , she argued , In its absence of conclusiveness and its abandonment to reverie , the poem appeals to readers who prize it as the most personal , the most apparently spontaneous , the most immediately beautiful , and the most confessional of Keats 's odes . I believe that the ' events ' of the ode , as it unfolds in time , have more logic , however , than is usually granted them , and that they are best seen in relation to Keats 's pursuit of the idea of music as a nonrepresentational art . 
On 1 January , 98 , at the start of his fourth consulship , Nerva suffered a stroke during a private audience . Shortly thereafter he was struck by a fever and died at his villa in the Gardens of Sallust , on 28 January . He was deified by the Senate , and his ashes were laid to rest in the Mausoleum of Augustus .
All of the novel 's storylines concern memory in some sense or another . The most apparent confrontation of memory is on the part of Urania Cabral , who has returned to the Dominican Republic for the first time in 30 years , and is forced to confront her father and the traumas that led her to leave the country at 14 . She was the victim of sexual abuse at the hands of the dictator himself , a sacrifice her father made to try to gain favor with the dictator again , a fact to which she alludes throughout the book , but which is only revealed at the very end : the book concludes with her recounting the memory of that night to her aunt and cousins , who never knew the true reason she left the country . When her aunt is surprised that she remembers all these details , she responds that while she forgets many things , I remember everything about that night . For Urania , forgetting the atrocities committed by the regime is unacceptable . Her father , on the other hand , is not capable of joining her in this process of remembering , since he has suffered a stroke and is not capable of speaking ; however , Urania is angry that he chose to forget these things while he was still capable of acknowledging them .

Soon after his return to the United States , Gore reentered state politics , winning election to the Massachusetts Senate . He was active in the state Federalist Party organization , sitting on its secret central committee . He resumed his law practice , in which he took on as a student Daniel Webster . One of the highest profile cases he took on was the 1807 defense of Thomas Selfridge , accused of murdering Charles Austin . Selfridge , an older Federalist attorney , had been retained to assist in the collection of a debt from Austin 's Republican father . In the politically charged atmosphere of the day in Boston , Selfridge , fearing for his own safety , had armed himself with a dueling pistol . The younger Austin had , apparently on his own initiative , sought to beat Selfridge with a cane , and Selfridge fatally shot him in the encounter . Selfridge was prosecuted by Attorney General and future Gore gubernatorial opponent James Sullivan , and the defense also included arch - Federalist Harrison Gray Otis . Gore argued Selfridge acted in self - defense ; Selfridge was acquitted of murder by a jury whose foreman was Patriot and Federalist Paul Revere after fifteen minutes ' deliberation .
 Politics and The Great Depression 
Harihara or Harisvara , 1160 , who came from a family of karnikas accountants in Hampi , was one of the earliest Veerashaiva writers who was not part of the Vachana poetic tradition . He is considered one of the most influential Kannada poets of the Hoysala era . A non - traditionalist , he has been called poet of poets and a poet for the masses . Kannada poetry changed course because of his efforts , and he was an inspiration for generations of poets to follow . Impressed by his early writings , Kereya Padmarasa , the court poet of King Narasimha I , introduced him to the king , who became Harihara 's patron . A master of many metres , he authored the Girijakalyana Marriage of the mountain born goddess Parvati in the Kalidasa tradition , employing the champu style to tell a 10 - part story leading to the marriage of the god Shiva and Parvati . According to an anecdote , Harihara was so against eulogising earthly mortals that he struck his prot g Raghavanka for writing about King Harishchandra in the landmark work Harishchandra Kavya c . 1200 . Harihara is credited with developing the native ragale metre . The earliest poetic biographer in the Kannada language , he wrote a biography of Basavanna called Basavarajadevara ragale , which gives interesting details about the protagonist while not always conforming to popular beliefs of the time . Ascribed to him is a group of 100 poems called the Nambiyanana ragale also called Shivaganada ragale or Saranacharitamanasa The holy lake of the lives of the devotees after the saint Nambiyana . In the sataka metre he wrote the Pampa sataka , and in the ashtaka metre , the Mudige ashtaka in about 1200 .

Ayola 's first prolific television role was in the ITV drama Soldier Soldier , in which she starred throughout its third series in 1993 as soldier 's wife Bernie Roberts . Ayola credits her chemistry with co - star Akim Mogaji , who played her on - screen husband Luke Roberts , for winning her her audition . She went on to appear in Gone With the Wind sequel Scarlett , and star in Welsh soap opera Tiger Bay . She has spoken critically of the way the BBC treated the soap , moving it around the schedules and declining to commission a second series . She acted alongside Pauline Quirke in both Maisie Raine and Being April , deeming Quirke to be a fantastic actress , and one she would work alongside again like a shot . In 1996 , Ayola appeared at the National Theatre in Helen Edmundson 's adaptation of Leo Tolstoy 's War and Peace . In 2001 , she became a presenter of the BBC Wales arts programme Double Yellow , alongside poet Owen Sheers and performance artist Mark Rees . She posed nude but for a pair of yellow rubber gloves to promote the show 's launch , and was highly critical of the BBC when the show was cancelled midway through its second series . She has since concluded that the kind of audience they would like to bring in with shows like Double Yellow aren 't really into watching TV , but at the time was outspoken against the show 's cancellation , stating :
A few hours after developing , the depression attained tropical storm status , or winds of at least 40 mph 65 km h . Upon doing so , the National Hurricane Center NHC gave it the name Olaf . The upper - level low , which was moving away from the region , caused the storm to move northward toward the Mexican coast . Olaf quickly intensified , as evidenced by reports from a nearby ship , and the winds reached 70 mph 115 km h by late on September 27 ; the NHC anticipated further intensification to hurricane status , or winds of at least 75 mph 120 km h . Instead , interaction with the rough terrain of Mexico caused weakening . Olaf made landfall on Salina Cruz , Oaxaca early on September 29 as a 35 mph 55 km h tropical depression . Within a few hours , the circulation was not evident on satellite imagery , and the NHC discontinued advisories .
The basidia are 15 25 3 . 5 5 . 5 m and have a slim , club - like shape . Each basidium features four sterigmata , each of which bear one spore . The spores ' shape is slimly ellipsoidal or cylindrical . Their surface is smooth and their walls are thin . Although they are colourless and hyaline , the spores are amyloid , meaning they will turn bluish or purple when stained with Melzer 's reagent . This characteristic differs from other very similar species , and this gave the genus its name .
Kleinman contacted a pair of Canadian graphic novel artists to begin the storyboarding process . Storyboarding the commercial meant that the agency could determine how much of the 1.3M budget to allocate to each section , and provided them with visuals to use as part of the presentation to Diageo when pitching the various concepts for a decision on which to pursue . The effort paid off and approval was given to move ahead with production .
 Population control and study 
The partly unglaciated Middle Colonies enjoyed fertile soil vastly different from the nearby New England Colonies , which contained more rocky soil . Because of the large grain exports resulting from this soil , the colonies came to be known as the Bread Basket Colonies . Pennsylvania became a leading exporter of wheat , corn , rye , hemp , and flax , making it the leading food producer in the colonies , and later states , between the years of 1725 and 1840 . Broad navigable rivers of relaxed current like the Susquehanna River , the Delaware River , and the Hudson River attracted diverse business . Fur trappers moved along these rivers , and there was enough flow to enable milling with water wheel power .
Books written by modern - day martial artists make many claims that are not congruent with historical documents or current scholarly thought . For instance , internalist Yang Jwing - Ming says Zhou was a scholar who studied martial arts in the Shaolin Monastery and later took Yue as his student after the young man worked as a tenant farmer for the official - general Han Qi , 1008 1075 . During this time , he learned all types of military weapons , horseback riding , and hand - to - hand combat . The General later created Xingyi and Eagle Claw boxing from his internal and external training under Zhou . However , history Prof. Meir Shahar notes that unarmed boxing styles did not develop at Shaolin until the late Ming Dynasty . He also states that Ji family memoirs and Qing Dynasty records suggest Xingyi was created hundreds of years after the death of Yue by a spearplayer named Ji Jike fl . 1651 . In addition , the appearance of Han Qi in the story is a chronological anachronism since he died nearly 30 years before Yue 's birth . Yue historically worked as a tenant farmer and bodyguard for descendants of Han Qi in 1124 after leaving the military upon the death of his father in late 1122 , but he learned from Zhou well before this time .
Warbrick started assembling a team for the tour in early 1888 . He had difficulties assembling a squad due to player availability , and failed to secure the talented Jack Taiaroa due to his university commitments . Some M ori players who initially agreed to play later pulled out when the eligibility criteria were relaxed to allow squad members who were only part - M ori . Twenty M ori or part - M ori players joined the squad ; five P keh white New Zealand players were added after the team lost to Auckland . Due to the inclusion of these P keh players the team was renamed from the New Zealand Maori to the New Zealand Native Football Representatives . The final squad comprised 26 players including Warbrick ; of these at least five were full - blooded M ori , while fourteen had a M ori mother and a P keh father . The parentage of some of the players is unknown .

On the other hand , opponents of the Bedell plan had a very different view of this legislation . Representatives such as Pat Roberts claimed that the referendum was redundant because the farmers already voted the politicians into office , and this bill was an example of the politicians not doing their jobs . The Reagan Administration opposed the bill because of their opposition to production controls , and the President threatened to veto the farm bill if Bedell 's plan was left in place . When the bill got to the floor , an amendment was proposed to strike this provision , and it was passed 251 - 174 .
In 263 , after his return , Odaenathus assumed the title King of Kings of the East Mlk Mlk , and headed to Antioch , the traditional capital of Syria , where he crowned his son Hairan I as co - King of Kings . The title was a symbol of legitimacy in the East , starting with the Assyrians then the Achaemenids who used it to symbolize their supremacy over all other rulers and was adopted by the Parthian monarchs following their defeat of the Seleucids to legitimize their conquests . The first Sassanian monarch Ardashir I adopted the title following his victory over the Parthians . Odaenathus ' son was crowned with a diadem and a tiara ; the choice of the location was probably meant to express that the Palmyrene monarchs were now the successors of the Seleucid and Iranian rulers who controlled Syria and Mesopotamia in the past .
This series of successful British infantry and mounted operations resulted in the complete defeat of the 16 , 000 to 18 , 000 strong German , Austrian and Ottoman force , about half of whom were killed or wounded , and nearly 4 , 000 taken prisoner . Also captured were a mountain gun battery of four heavy guns , nine machine guns , a complete camel - pack machine gun company , 2 , 300 rifles and a million rounds of ammunition , two complete field hospitals with all instruments , fittings and drugs , while a great quantity of stores in the supply depot at Bir el Abd was destroyed . All the captured arms and equipment were made in Germany , and the camel - pack machine gun company 's equipment had been especially designed for desert warfare . Many of the rifles were of the latest pattern and made of rustless steel . Murray estimated the total German and Ottoman casualties at about 9 , 000 , while a German estimate put the loss at one third of the force 5 , 500 to 6 , 000 , which seems low considering the number of prisoners .

The cell nucleus contains the majority of the cell 's genetic material in the form of multiple linear DNA molecules organized into structures called chromosomes . Each human cell contains roughly two meters of DNA . During most of the cell cycle these are organized in a DNA - protein complex known as chromatin , and during cell division the chromatin can be seen to form the well - defined chromosomes familiar from a karyotype . A small fraction of the cell 's genes are located instead in the mitochondria .

The Church of Scientology has a history of conflict with groups on the Internet . In 1995 , attorneys for the Church of Scientology attempted to get the newsgroup alt.religion.scientology a.r.s. removed from Usenet . This attempt backfired and generated a significant amount of press for a.r.s. The conflict with a.r.s led the hacker group Cult of the Dead Cow to declare war on the Church of Scientology . The Church of Scientology mounted a 10 - year legal campaign against Dutch writer Karin Spaink and several Internet service providers after Spaink and others posted documents alleged to be secret teachings of the organization . The Church of Scientology 's efforts ended in a legal defeat in a Dutch court in 2005 . This series of events is often referred to as Scientology versus the Internet .

In 2003 , Joachim G ntner , writing in the Swiss Neue Z rcher Zeitung , noted that Gerhard Besier , a German Christian theologian , director of the Hannah Arendt Institute for Research into Totalitarianism in Dresden and recipient of an honorary doctorate from Lund University , Sweden , for his championing of religious freedom , had been pressured to forego publication of his scientific study of Scientology after having found himself the subject of widespread criticism in the German media for advocating a more tolerant attitude towards Scientology . G ntner concluded that alarmism had triumphed over science and noted an apparent lack of confidence in Germany 's ability to engage in open public discourse on the matter .
The post - First World War years marked a decline in Welsh rugby . An industrial recession struck the principality , and hurt South Wales in particular . Welsh international results in the 1920s mirrored the performance of the economy : of their 42 matches they won only 17 , with three drawn . Half - a - million people emigrated from Wales to find work elsewhere during the depression ; this included many Welsh rugby union internationals who moved to the professional code of rugby league . Between 1923 and 1928 , Wales managed only seven victories five of them against France . However , even France managed to defeat Wales that decade ; achieving their first victory over Wales in 1928 . Welsh selection policy reflected the upheavals of the mid - 1920s . In 1924 , 35 different players were selected for Wales ' four matches , with a different captain for each ; and only Edward Watkins in the backs and Charlie Pugh in the forwards , playing in all four matches .
On October 6 , 1993 , Jordan announced his retirement , citing a loss of desire to play the game . Jordan later stated that the murder of his father earlier in the year also shaped his decision . Jordan 's father was murdered on July 23 , 1993 , at a highway rest area in Lumberton , North Carolina , by two teenagers , Daniel Green and Larry Martin Demery . The assailants were traced from calls they made on James Jordan 's cellular phone , caught , convicted , and sentenced to life in prison . Jordan was close to his father ; as a child he had imitated his father 's proclivity to stick out his tongue while absorbed in work . He later adopted it as his own signature , displaying it each time he drove to the basket . In 1996 , he founded a Chicago area Boys Girls Club and dedicated it to his father .
The early uses of antimonium include the translations , in 1050 1100 , by Constantine the African of Arabic medical treatises . Several authorities believe antimonium is a scribal corruption of some Arabic form ; Meyerhof derives it from ithmid ; other possibilities include athimar , the Arabic name of the metalloid , and a hypothetical as - stimmi , derived from or parallel to the Greek .

Tropical Storm Brenda was the second named storm of the 1960 Atlantic hurricane season . It developed in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico on July 28 , and after moving ashore over the Florida Peninsula , it attained tropical storm status . Brenda accelerated northeast along the U.S. East Coast , ultimately peaking as a moderate storm with winds of 60 mph 97 km h before crossing the Mid - Atlantic states and New England ; it dissipated on July 31 over southern Canada . The storm inflicted moderate damage in Florida , the worst since Hurricane Easy of 1950 , and dropped heavy rainfall as far north as New York City . Total damage is estimated at US 5 million , and only indirect deaths are blamed on the cyclone .
Dow ceased operations at its Sarnia site in 2009 . The plant was decommissioned , and the land has been sold to neighbouring TransAlta Energy Corporation . TransAlta produces power and steam for industry , and is the largest natural gas co - generation plant in Canada . It has created the Bluewater Energy Park on the former Dow site .

She has penchant for her pacifier , on which she is always seen sucking .
Historians Paul Moorcraft and Peter McLaughlin write that this exaggerated considerably the actual number of guerrillas killed , as most of Nkomo 's army , then numbering about 10 , 000 fighters , had not been touched . On the other hand , unarmed refugees often camped in or around insurgent positions , and hundreds of these had been killed in the Rhodesian raid . Moorcraft and McLaughlin comment that for the Rhodesian airmen , it would have been impossible to distinguish innocent refugees from young ZIPRA recruits . Sibanda describes Freedom Camp as a refugee camp for boys , and says 351 boys and girls were killed . He claims that the Red Cross and the UN Refugee Agency confirmed ZAPU 's claim that Smith 's forces struck at defenseless , civilian trainees .

Church teaching of the Commandments is largely based on the Old and New Testaments and the writings of the early Church Fathers . In the New Testament , Jesus acknowledged their validity and instructed his disciples to go further , demanding a righteousness exceeding that of the scribes and Pharisees . Summarized by Jesus into two Great Commandments that teach love of God and love of neighbor , they instruct individuals on their relationships with both . The first three commandments demand respect for God 's name , observation of the Lord 's Day and prohibit the worship of other gods . The others deal with the relationships between individuals , such as that between parent and child ; they include prohibitions against lying , stealing , murdering , adultery and covetousness .

Since no inscriptions on any of the island have been discovered , the ancient history of the island is conjectural , at best . Pandavas , the heroes of the Hindu epic Mahabharata , and Banasura , the demon devotee of Shiva , are both credited with building temples or cut caves to live . Local tradition holds that the caves are not man - made .

On February 8 , 2009 , Rihanna was reported to have been involved in an altercation with her boyfriend , Chris Brown . He allegedly punched Rihanna and threatened to kill her . Brown turned himself in to the police and pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault during the trial . August Brown called the murder ballad theme an apparent warning to Chris Brown and a response to his song Deuces 2010 , which denounces an ex - lover . Kitty Empire of The Guardian wrote that Brown 's assault on Rihanna gives the song lyrical context , and sings it with a bittersweet menace tone . When asked by HipHopDX about how he reacted to listeners of the song saying that it condones violence , Sham dismissed the accusations :

The black - tailed jackrabbit plays host to many ectoparasites including fleas , ticks , lice , and mites , and many endoparasites including trematodes , cestodes , nematodes , and botfly Cuterebra larvae . Diseases affecting the black - tailed jackrabbit in the West are tularemia , equine encephalitis , brucellosis , Q fever , and Rocky Mountain spotted fever . Ticks are vectors for tularemia , and infected ticks have been found on jackrabbits in the West . Jackrabbits infected with tularemia die very quickly .
Alan Rotherham and Harry Vassall , both 19th - century greats for Oxford and England , were inducted into the IRB Hall in April 2011 . The IRB recognised them for their unique contribution to the way that Rugby was played , specifically stating that they are credited with pioneering the passing game and the three - man backline , which became widespread during the 1880s . 
The island has two groups of caves in the rock - cut architectural style . The caves are hewn from solid basalt rock . All caves were painted in the past , but only traces remain . The larger group of caves , which consists of five caves on the western hill of the island , is well known for its Hindu sculptures . The primary cave , numbered as Cave 1 , is about 1 . 5 km 0 . 93 mi up a hillside , facing the ocean . It is a rock - cut temple complex that covers an area of 5 , 600 m2 60 , 000 sq ft , and consists of a main chamber , two lateral chambers , courtyards , and subsidiary shrines . It is 39 metres 128 ft deep from the front entrance to the back . The temple complex is the abode of Shiva , depicted in widely celebrated carvings which reveal his several forms and acts .
A similar sentiment was expressed in a 1968 episode of the animated series Wacky Races titled The Wrong Lumber Race , where the villainous Dick Dastardly chops down a tree and uses it as a roadblock against the other racers , declaring proudly : I think that I shall never see A roadblock lovely as a tree . 
In the 1890s , the lighthouse was first formally proposed to mark the Norwalk Harbor . In 1899 , the United States Congress appropriated 60 , 000 for the establishment of a light and fog signal at Greens Ledge . In 1900 , the Philadelphia Construction Company was contracted to construct the foundation and the superstructure . The design for this type of lighthouse was first realized in 1873 , from Major Eliiot of the Lighthouse Board . The foundation form is made of identical curved - iron plates with top inward - pointing flanges that are bolted together and secured with knees . The assembled rings are lowered into the water and filled with concrete or stone , concrete for the Greens Ledge Light . A series of photographs from the work in 1901 shows the assembly of the three lower courses at Wilson 's Point , the lowering of the cylinder and the light in the fall of 1901 prior to a deposit of protective riprap .
Temnospondyli from Greek temnein , to cut and spondylos , vertebra is a diverse subclass of extinct small to giant tetrapods often considered primitive amphibians that flourished worldwide during the Carboniferous , Permian , and Triassic periods . A few species continued into the Cretaceous . Fossils have been found on every continent . During about 210 million years of evolutionary history , they adapted to a wide range of habitats , including fresh water , terrestrial , and even coastal marine environments . Their life history is well understood , with fossils known from the larval stage , metamorphosis , and maturity . Most temnospondyls were semiaquatic , although some were almost fully terrestrial , returning to the water only to breed . These temnospondyls were some of the first vertebrates fully adapted to life on land . Although temnospondyls are considered amphibians , many had characteristics , such as scales , claws , and armour - like bony plates , that distinguish them from modern amphibians .
Josce was the youngest son of Geoffrey de Dinan and Radegonde Orieldis , and had two older brothers , Oliver of Dinan and Alan of Becherel . Josce 's family was from Brittany , and he was described by the historian Marjorie Chibnall as an obscure Breton adventurer . Josce moved from Devon in southern England to the Welsh Marches , the border between England and Wales , because the lords of Monmouth were also of Breton extraction . While in the Marches he joined King Stephen 's household .
... the jury instructions and verdict sheet in this case involved an unreasonable application of federal law . The charge and verdict form created a reasonable likelihood that the jury believed it was precluded from considering any mitigating circumstance that had not been found unanimously to exist .
Palencia - Roth notes that critics have been struck by the humorless elegiac style of The General in His Labyrinth ; its dark mood and somber message is similar to that of The Autumn of the Patriarch . Love is a theme common to both Love in the Time of Cholera and The General in His Labyrinth , but the latter is considered a tragedy . These two novels have been used to demonstrate the range of Garc a M rquez 's work .
Monsieur Bertin was exhibited at the 1833 Salon alongside his 1807 Portrait of Mme Devau ay . It met with near universal praise to become his most successful artwork to that point . It sealed his reputation as a portraitist , reaching far enough into public consciousness to become a standard for newspaper political satires . Today it is considered his greatest portrait . Ingres viewed all this as a mixed blessing , remarking that since my portraits of Bertin and Mol , everybody wants portraits . There are six that I 've turned down , or am avoiding , because I can 't stand them . Before the official exhibition , Ingres displayed the painting in his studio for friends and pupils . Most were lavish in their praise , although Louis Lacuria confided to a friend that he feared people might find the colouring a bit dreary . He proved correct ; at the Salon , critics praised the draftsmanship , but some felt the portrait exemplified Ingres ' weakness as a colourist . It was routinely faulted for its purplish tone which the ageing of the oil medium has transformed over time to warm greys and browns . Bertin 's wife Louis - Marie reportedly did not like the painting ; his daughter , Louise , thought it transformed her father from a great lord to a fat farmer .

Less than 10 of the population of the Republic of Ireland today speak Irish regularly outside of the education system and 38 of those over 15 years are classified as Irish speakers . In Northern Ireland , English is the de facto official language , but official recognition is afforded to Irish , including specific protective measures under Part III of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages . A lesser status including recognition under Part II of the Charter is given to Ulster Scots dialects , which are spoken by roughly 2 of Northern Ireland residents , and also spoken by some in the Republic of Ireland . Since the 1960s with the increase in immigration , many more languages have been introduced , particularly deriving from Asia and Eastern Europe .
The noisy miner is endemic to eastern and south - eastern Australia , occupying a broad arc from Far North Queensland where there are scattered populations , to New South Wales where it is widespread and common from the coast to a line from Angledool to Balranald , through Victoria into south - eastern South Australia , and eastern Tasmania . Its range in South Australia has been steadily expanding since it was first recorded near Adelaide in the early 1890s . It is sedentary over its entire range . The noisy miner is territorial , and the territory of a colony is aggressively defended which has led to a significant reduction in avian diversity in areas occupied by the noisy miner , with smaller species excluded .
Vistara has interline agreements with the following airlines :
During this period Australia continued to retain forces in Malaysia as part of the Five Power Defence Arrangements FPDA agreed in 1971 to defend it in the event of external attack , with this commitment initially including significant air , ground and naval forces . However , these forces were gradually reduced with the infantry battalion withdrawn from Singapore in 1973 , and the two Mirage fighter squadrons in 1988 . Since then a detachment of Orion maritime patrol aircraft , support personnel , and an infantry company known as Rifle Company Butterworth have been maintained , as well as occasional deployments of F A - 18 Hornet fighter aircraft . Australian submarines were reportedly also involved in a number of clandestine surveillance missions throughout Asian waters in the last decades of the Cold War . Airforce and Navy units were also involved in tracking Soviet ship and submarine movements in the region . Since then the Orions have continued to participate in maritime security operations as part of Operation Gateway , conducting patrols over the Indian Ocean , Strait of Malacca and South China Sea . They have reportedly also been involved in freedom of navigation flights .
Other naval units involved were two Hunt class destroyers , HMS Tynedale L96 and Atherstone L05 , which would accompany the force to and from the French coast and remain out at sea during the raid . A Motor Gun Boat MGB 314 was the headquarters ship for the raid , with Commander Ryder and the commanding officer of the Commandos on board . A Motor Torpedo Boat MTB 74 , commanded by Sub - Lieutenant Michael Wynn , had two objectives : If the outer Normandie dock gates were open , she had to torpedo the inner dock gates . If the gates were closed she would instead torpedo the gates at the old entrance into the St Nazaire basin .
Family feud : According to Zonaras , Odaenathus ' nephew misbehaved during a lion hunt ; he made the first attack and killed the animal to the dismay of the king . Odaenathus warned the nephew who ignored the warning and repeated the act twice causing the king to deprive him of his horse which is a great insult in the East . The nephew threatened Odaenathus and was put in chains as a result ; Hairan I asked his father to forgive his cousin and his request was granted but as the king was drinking , the nephew approached him with a sword and killed him along with Hairan I. The bodyguard immediately executed the nephew .
There is at least one example of surveillance of Scientology by the German intelligence services outside of Germany . In 1998 , the Swiss government detained an agent of the German government , charging him with carrying out illegal business for a foreign state , working for a political information service and falsifying identity documents . The German government posted bail for the agent . He was eventually given a 30 - day suspended jail sentence for spying on Scientology , and the German government apologized to Switzerland for the incident .

Ethnographer James Teit records that the people of the Adams River area formed a sub - group of the Secwepemc called the Sxste 'lln , now known as the Adams Lake Indian Band . The Sxste 'lln moved between summer and winter camps at the outlet of the lower river and the Little River area near Chase . The river 's namesake , Chief Sel - howt - ken baptized as Adam by Oblate missionaries was a Sxste 'lln leader in the 1860s . Like more than 200 of his people , he died in the 1862 smallpox epidemic .
In England , one of the gliders never left the ground , as its tow rope had snapped on taxiing . The other two gliders , unable to locate the battery , did not land where expected . On their run in , both gliders were hit by anti - aircraft fire . One landed around 2 miles 3 . 2 km away , the other at the edge of the minefield . The troops from this glider became involved in a fire fight with German troops heading to reinforce the battery garrison .

Already suffering from severe flooding that killed at least 18 people and left 200 , 000 homeless , Hurricane Brenda worsened the situation with torrential rainfall and additional flooding . The storm killed at least 10 people in the country . Following the damage wrought by Brenda , a large earthquake struck the region , hampering relief efforts and collapsing numerous structures . Winds on land gusted up to 112 mph 180 km h , leading to severe wind damage . Two of the fatalities occurred in Campeche after 80 of the city was flooded . This was considered the worst flooding in the city in over 25 years . An estimated 2 , 000 people were left homeless as a direct result of Brenda throughout Mexico . Offshore , a freighter with 25 crewman became trapped in the storm after its engines failed . They were safely rescued several days later once the storm had dissipated .

The invisible rail inhabits the dense , spiky sago swamps of Halmahera , particularly where forest adjoins the boggy areas . Claims that the rail occurs in alang - alang grass are thought to have arisen from confusion with the pale - vented bush - hen . German ornithologist Gerd Heinrich , who prepared for his Halmahera trip by rolling in stinging nettles , wrote of the sago swamp habitat in the 1930s :
Entering the 2006 Major League Baseball MLB draft , Kershaw was considered the top high - school pitcher available . The Los Angeles Dodgers selected Kershaw with the seventh overall pick in the draft . He had committed to Texas A M University , but turned down the scholarship offer to sign with the Dodgers , with a bonus estimated at 2 . 3 million . The bonus was the largest to any Dodgers draft pick at the time , and was eventually topped by Zach Lee in the 2010 draft .
 Ramblin ' Man features a conversation between an interviewer the voice of Michael Deakin father of Lemon Jelly 's Fred Deakin and John the Ramblin ' Man the voice of Standing , during which he lists various places from around the world , ranging from from small Sussex villages to major world capitals . When listed in the order in which the locations are narrated , the message Bagpuss Sees All Things is spelled out midway through the song from Brixton at four minutes ten seconds , to San Jos at four minutes 31 seconds using the first letter of each location . The fourth track , Return to Patagonia , features several jazz - inspired elements .
The Olmec colossal heads are at least seventeen monumental stone representations of human heads sculpted from large basalt boulders . The heads date from at least before 900 BC and are a distinctive feature of the Olmec civilization of ancient Mesoamerica . All portray mature men with fleshy cheeks , flat noses , and slightly crossed eyes ; their physical characteristics correspond to a type that is still common among the inhabitants of Tabasco and Veracruz . The backs of the monuments often are flat . The boulders were brought from the Sierra de los Tuxtlas mountains of Veracruz . Given that the extremely large slabs of stone used in their production were transported over large distances , requiring a great deal of human effort and resources , it is thought that the monuments represent portraits of powerful individual Olmec rulers . Each of the known examples has a distinctive headdress . The heads were variously arranged in lines or groups at major Olmec centres , but the method and logistics used to transport the stone to these sites remain unclear .
After the war , McNichol returned to Hurlford , but , amid interest from other clubs , he accepted a trial with Newcastle United . After two trial matches , he signed professional forms with the club on his 21st birthday . McNichol spent two years at Newcastle , but never made a first - team appearance . Behind the likes of England international forwards Roy Bentley and Len Shackleton in the pecking order , he doubled his income working as a motor mechanic for a local funeral director whose two or three Rolls - Royces made a nice change from working on bus engines . In his second season , he was part of the reserve team that won the Central League title , but a disagreement over personal terms on his contract renewal the Newcastle management felt a lower wage was justified because of the player 's earnings outside the game prompted McNichol to seek first - team football elsewhere .
Wales enjoyed a second golden age in the 1970s , with world - class players such as Gareth Edwards , J. P. R. Williams , Gerald Davies , Barry John , and Mervyn Davies , in their side . Wales dominated Northern Hemisphere rugby between 1969 and 1979 , and attained an incredible winning record , losing only seven times during that period . Wales toured New Zealand for the first time in 1969 , but were defeated in both Tests . As well as losing the first Test 19 0 , and the second 33 12 , they also conceded 24 points to the All Blacks ' fullback Fergie McCormick in the second Test ; a record at the time .
Games in the Guitar Hero series have been generally well received by critics . The initial games were highly praised by reviewers . Neversoft 's first entry to the series , Guitar Hero III , was considered to be too difficult , with many difficult songs presenting players with walls of notes ; the developers later acknowledged this . Subsequent efforts in Guitar Hero : Aerosmith and Guitar Hero World Tour were seen to have some improvements , with Guitar Hero : Metallica considered to be a well - polished title and , at that time , the best Guitar Hero title Neversoft has produced . Guitar Hero 5 's improvements toward social gameplay were complemented by reviewers and considered a further improvement upon the series . Entertainment Weekly put it on its end - of - the - decade , best - of list , saying , An addictive videogame provides the illusion of musical mastery for even the least gifted : . How do you get to Carnegie Hall ? Tap , tap , tap . 
Over the past 1200 years , Vikings , Normans , Welsh , Flemings , Scots , English , Africans , Eastern Europeans and South Americans have all added to the population and have had significant influences on Irish culture .
Because the kakapo is long - lived , with an average life expectancy of 95 years and the maximum at about 120 years , it tends to have an adolescence before it starts breeding . Males do not start to boom until about 5 years of age . It was thought that females reached sexual maturity at 9 years of age , but this idea was debunked in the 2008 breeding season when two 6 - year - old females named Apirama and Rakiura laid eggs . Generally females do not seek out males until they are between 9 and 11 years old . The kakapo does not breed every year and has one of the lowest rates of reproduction among birds . Breeding occurs only in years when trees mast fruit heavily , providing a plentiful food supply . Rimu mast occurs only every three to five years , so in rimu - dominant forests such as those on Codfish Island , kakapo breeding occurs as infrequently .
At this period , there were very few jobs available within British archaeology ; as the later archaeologist Stuart Piggott related , the young Wheeler was looking for a professional job where the profession had yet to be created . In 1913 Wheeler secured a position as junior investigator for the English Royal Commission on Historical Monuments , who were embarking on a project to assess the state of all structures in the nation that pre - dated 1714 . As part of this , he was first sent to Stebbing in Essex to assess Late Medieval buildings , although once that was accomplished he focused on studying the Romano - British remains of that county . In summer 1914 he married Tessa in a low - key , secular wedding ceremony , before they moved into Wheeler 's parental home in Herne Hill .

From their teens to early twenties , Mosley and his brother were involved with their father 's post - war party , the Union Movement UM , which advocated a united Europe as its core issue . Trevor Grundy , a central figure in the UM 's Youth Movement , writes of the 16 - year - old Mosley painting the flash and circle symbol on walls in London on the night of the Soviet Union 's invasion of Hungary 4 November 1956 . The flash and circle was used by both the UM and the pre - war BUF . He also says Mosley organised a couple of large parties as a way to get in with lively , ordinary , normal young people , girls as well as boys , and attract them to the Movement by showing that we were like them and didn 't go on about Hitler and Mussolini , Franco and British Fascism all the time . Mosley met his future wife Jean at such a party . Mosley and Alexander were photographed posing as Teddy Boys in Notting Hill during the 1958 race riots between Afro - Caribbeans and local white gangs of Teddy Boys . The following year , they canvassed for their father when he ran as a Union Movement candidate for the nearby Kensington North seat in the 1959 General Election .
Following his term as governor , Beckham made a bid to become a U.S. Senator . His stance in favor of prohibition cost him the votes of four legislators in his own party and the seat went to Republican William O. Bradley . Six years later Beckham secured the seat by popular election , but he lost his re - election bid largely because of his pro - temperance views and his opposition to women 's suffrage . Though he continued to play an active role in state politics for another two decades , he never returned to elected office , failing in his gubernatorial bid in 1927 and his senatorial campaign in 1936 . He died in Louisville on January 9 , 1940 .

Flooding damages on the Mississippi Missouri river system were one of the primary reasons for which Congress passed the Flood Control Act of 1944 , opening the way for the USACE to develop the Missouri on a massive scale . The 1944 act authorized the Pick Sloan Missouri Basin Program Pick Sloan Plan , which was a composite of two widely varying proposals . The Pick plan , with an emphasis on flood control and hydroelectric power , called for the construction of large storage dams along the main stem of the Missouri . The Sloan plan , which stressed the development of local irrigation , included provisions for roughly 85 smaller dams on tributaries .
The sinking of the British capital ships Prince of Wales and Repulse by Japanese land - based aircraft on 10 December 1941 led the IJN to realize that battleships could not operate in the face of enemy aircraft and required friendly air support to protect them . The loss of four Japanese aircraft carriers during the Battle of Midway in June 1942 severely limited the ability of the IJN to provide any air cover and alternatives were sought . Earlier proposals to convert one or more battleships into carriers had been made and rejected at the beginning of the war , but they were revived after Midway . Plans for more elaborate conversions were rejected on the grounds of expense and , most critically , time , and the IJN settled on removing the rear pair of turrets and replacing them with a flight deck equipped with two catapults to launch floatplanes . The Ise - class ships were selected for the conversion because Hy ga had suffered an explosion in Turret No. 5 in early May that virtually destroyed the turret and their Turret No. 6 could not elevate to the full 43 degrees deemed necessary for the long - range engagement anticipated by the IJN . The Fus s were scheduled to follow once the first two were completed .

 The Sixth Extinction received mixed to positive reviews from critics . Tom Kessenich , in his book Examination : An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6 9 of the X - Files gave the episode a positive review , noting that the episode takes the themes of Biogenesis and runs with them . Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly awarded the episode a B . Tucker praised series creator Chris Carter 's writing ability , stating that the kickoff episode suggests the author 's limitless imagination for sustaining his alien - nation tropes . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X - Files , Millennium The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode three - and - a - half stars out of five . The two called the episode the most arresting season opener in years and noted that it promises that maybe there 's life in the old mythology yet . Shearman and Pearson , however , did critique the lack of finality to the episode , but attributed most of this to the fact that the episode was the second of a three - part mythology tale . Den of Geek writer Nina Sordi ranked The Sixth Extinction , along with Biogenesis and The Sixth Extinction II : Amor Fati , as the fifth best episode of the series , writing , it is evident that as The X - Files progressed , the episodes surrounding those storylines and the breaking points Mulder and Scully endured push them further and further towards total , irreversible defeat . This is especially poignant when viewing this anxiety inducing trio of episodes . Monica S. Kuebler of Exclaim magazine called The Sixth Extinction , along with Biogenesis and Amor Fati , one of the best episodes during the show 's colonization phase . Kenneth Silber of Space.com wrote positively of the episode , hoping that it foreshadowed answers to come , writing As the middle installment of a three - part story and what was then thought to be the final season premiere of The X - Files , ' The Sixth Extinction ' is suffused with a somber pre - apocalyptic mood , but one vivified by the possibility that soon we 'll have answers to the most important outstanding mysteries of the series .

Among Busch 's last works were the stories Clement Dove , the Poet Thwarted Balduin B hlamm , der verhinderte Dichter 1883 and Painter Squirtle Maler Klecksel 1884 , both of which focus on artistic failure , and indirectly his own failure . Both stories begin with a preface , which , for biographer Joseph Kraus , were bravura pieces of Komische Lyrik German comic poetry . Clement Dove ridicules the bourgeois amateur poet circle of Munich , The Crocodiles Die Krokodile , and their prominent members Emanuel Geibel , Paul von Heyse and Adolf Wilbrandt . Painter Squirtle criticizes the bourgeois art connoisseur , who believes the worth of art is gauged by its price .

Mendes found that he still had to convince DreamWorks ' production executives to let him direct . He had already discussed the film with Jinks and Cohen , and felt they supported him . Ball was also keen ; having seen Cabaret , he was impressed with Mendes ' keen visual sense and thought he did not make obvious choices . Ball felt that Mendes liked to look under the story 's surface , a talent he felt would be a good fit with the themes of American Beauty . Mendes ' background also reassured him , because of the prominent role the playwright usually has in a theater production . Over two meetings the first with Cooper , Walter Parkes , and Laurie MacDonald , the second with Cooper alone Mendes pitched himself to the studio . The studio soon approached Mendes with a deal to direct for the minimum salary allowed under Directors Guild of America rules 150 , 000 . Mendes accepted , and later recalled that after taxes and his agent 's commission , he only earned 38 , 000 . In June 1998 , DreamWorks confirmed that it had contracted Mendes to direct the film .
The score was composed by Gray , who served as musical director for all of the Anderson productions up to the first series of Space : 1999 . In response to Gerry Anderson 's request that the main theme have a military feel , Gray produced a brass - dominated piece titled The Thunderbirds March , which was recorded in December 1964 at Olympic Studios in London . The end titles were originally to have been accompanied by Flying High , a lyrical track sung by Gary Miller with backing by Ken Barrie . Ultimately , a variation of the march was used instead . Incidental music was recorded over nine months between March and December 1965 . As most of the music budget was spent on the series ' earlier episodes , later instalments drew heavily on APF 's ever - expanding music library .

In March 1979 , Coleman went to RCA Records ' New York studio to produce an album with Prime Time by direct - to - disc recording . They had mechanical problems with the studio equipment and the recording was rejected . The failed session was a project under Phrase Text , Coleman 's music publishing company . He wanted to set up his own record company with the same name , and chose his old friend Kunle Mwanga as his manager . In April , Mwanga arranged another session at CBS Studios in New York City , and Coleman recorded Of Human Feelings there on April 25 ; the session was originally titled Fashion Faces . Jackson did not record with the band and Calvin Weston was hired in his place to play simultaneously with Denardo Coleman . They recorded all the album 's songs on the first take without any equipment problems . The album was recorded with a Sony PCM - 1600 two - track digital recorder , a rare item at the time . According to journalist Howard Mandel , the passages played by the band sounded neither very soft or loud on the album , because it had been mixed with a middle - frequency range and compressed dynamics . Because of the equipment used , Coleman did not embellish the album with added effects and avoided overdubbing , multi - tracking , and remixing . According to him , Of Human Feelings was the first jazz album to be digitally recorded in the United States .
At 1 , 656 square kilometres 639 sq mi , Skye is the second - largest island in Scotland after Lewis and Harris . The coastline of Skye is a series of peninsulas and bays radiating out from a centre dominated by the Cuillin hills Gaelic : An Cuiltheann . Malcolm Slesser suggested that its shape sticks out of the west coast of northern Scotland like a lobster 's claw ready to snap at the fish bone of Harris and Lewis and W. H. Murray , commenting on its irregular coastline , stated that Skye is sixty miles 100 km long , but what might be its breadth is beyond the ingenuity of man to state . Martin Martin , a native of the island , reported on it at length in a 1703 publication . His geological observations included a note that :

Starting on 11 February 1978 , 7 Independent Company spent half a week at Mount Darwin , where there was a major Army base . The company acquitted themselves well during this time , but one of their number was badly injured in a motor accident .

Edmond Mulet , UN Assistant Secretary - General for Peacekeeping Operations , said , I do not think we will ever know what the death toll is from this earthquake , while the director of the Haitian Red Cross , Jean - Pierre Guiteau , noted that his organization had not had the time to count bodies , as their focus had been on the treatment of survivors .
WASP - 13b is a transiting planet with an estimated mass that is including limb darkening 0 . 477 times that of Jupiter and a radius that is 1 . 389 times Jupiter 's radius . The planet is , in other words , less than half the mass of Jupiter , but slightly less than fourteen tenths its size . WASP - 13b 's low mass can mostly likely be attributed to the presence of a low - mass core , or to the total lack of a core , according to the discovery paper . WASP - 13b , which orbits its host star at a distance of 0 . 05362 AU , circles its star completely every 4 . 35298 days . The 2011 study on the planet recognized WASP - 13b as the fifth lowest - density extrasolar planet known , behind Kepler - 7b ; WASP - 17b ; TrES - 4b ; and COROT - 5b .
The 1955 Atlantic hurricane season was , at the time , the costliest season ever recorded . The hurricane season officially began on June 15 , 1955 , and ended on November 15 , 1955 . It was slightly above average , with 13 recorded tropical cyclones . The first storm , Alice , had persisted since December 30 , 1954 .

Tropical Storm Brenda caused two deaths and minor damage along the Gulf Coast of the United States in early August . The quick succession of Hurricanes Connie and Diane caused significant flooding in the Northeastern United States , with nearly 1 billion 1955 USD in losses and at least 232 fatalities . The next three storms Hurricanes Edith and Flora and Tropical Storm Five caused very minor or no impact . In early August , Hurricane Gladys caused severe localized flooding in Mexico , primarily in Mexico City . Additionally , an offshoot of Gladys inflicted minor impact in Texas .

First observed east of the Lesser Antilles on 17 August , the hurricane arrived at the Bahamas by 19 August . The disturbance continued to drift northward and made landfall at the mouth of the Cape Fear River in North Carolina on 22 August . The storm soon moved out to sea as a Category 2 - equivalent hurricane on the Saffir Simpson hurricane wind scale , persisting off of New England before dissipating south of Nova Scotia on 25 August as a markedly weaker storm . Several French and British military ships were damaged out at sea . In the Carolinas , salt , sugar , rice , and lumber industries suffered considerably , and several individuals were killed .

Just outside Ransomville , NY 93 leaves the town of Porter for the town of Wilson . It continues generally southeastward across mostly open terrain , meeting Randall Road CR 83 and Church Street CR 56 on its way to the town of Cambria . NY 93 becomes North Ridge Road at the town line , and it soon enters the hamlet of North Ridge , a community built up around the route 's intersection with NY 425 Cambria Wilson Road . The hamlet 's residential surroundings continue to the adjacent community of Molyneaux Corners , where NY 93 becomes concurrent with NY 104 Ridge Road . NY 93 and NY 104 proceed northeast across lightly populated areas for 2 miles 3 . 2 km to the hamlet of Warren Corners , at which point NY 93 splits from NY 104 and heads southward along Town Line Road .

In either 1916 or 1917 he joined the YMCA and did volunteer work in England for soldiers on leave ; in March 1917 he visited France , writing a poem about his experience afterwards something he had been doing more frequently since Oscar 's death and a collection of his war poetry , Ballad of Ensign Joy , was published later that year .
Mendes avoided using close - ups , as he believed the technique was overused ; he also cited Spielberg 's advice that he should imagine an audience silhouetted at the bottom of the camera monitor , to keep in mind that he was shooting for display on a 40 - foot 10 m screen . Spielberg who visited the set a few times also advised Mendes not to worry about costs if he had a great idea toward the end of a long working day . Mendes said , That happened three or four times , and they are all in the movie . Despite Spielberg 's support , DreamWorks and Mendes fought constantly over the schedule and budget , although the studio interfered little with the film 's content . Spacey , Bening and Hall worked for significantly less than their usual rates . American Beauty cost DreamWorks 15 million to produce , slightly above their projected sum . Mendes was so dissatisfied with his first three days ' filming that he obtained permission from DreamWorks to reshoot the scenes . He said , I started with a wrong scene , actually , a comedy scene . And the actors played it way too big : ... it was badly shot , my fault , badly composed , my fault , bad costumes , my fault ... ; and everybody was doing what I was asking . It was all my fault . Aware that he was a novice , Mendes drew on the experience of Hall : I made a very conscious decision early on , if I didn 't understand something technically , to say , without embarrassment , ' I don 't understand what you 're talking about , please explain it . '

Gore also resumed business activities upon his return . He invested in a wide variety of businesses and infrastructure , spurring economic activity in the state . His investments ranged widely , including maritime insurance where is father - in - law had made his fortune , bridges , locks , canals , and textiles . He was a major investor in the Middlesex Canal , the Craigie Bridge the first to connect Boston to Cambridge , and the Boston Manufacturing Company , whose factory proving the single - site production of textiles was in Waltham near his estate . Not all of his ventures panned out : the canal was in the long run a financial failure , as were efforts with other collaborators to develop Lechmere Point , the Cambridge side of the Craigie Bridge . The textile mill , however , was a success , and Gore invested in the Merrimack Manufacturing Company . When it decided to locate in what is now Lowell , Massachusetts , Gore purchased shares in the Proprietors of Locks and Canals , which operated and still owns today the Lowell canals .

Tech received Miami 's post - score kickoff needing to score quickly in order to have a chance to have a second opportunity on offense needed because Tech was now two scores behind . Tech returned the kickoff to the 24 - yard line but were penalized 12 yards for an illegal block . Casey passed for an eight - yard gain and ran for three yards for a first down . After that gain , things went against the Hokies . Casey was penalized 15 yards for intentional grounding , and Tech was unable to gain another first down . The Hokies punted , and Miami took over on offense at its 46 - yard line . In possession of the lead , Miami began to run out the clock , executing multiple rushing plays in succession in order to force the game clock to continue to count down . Tech 's defense forced a stop , but because Miami punted the ball with just 2 : 20 remaining in the game , there was little chance that Tech would be able to make up the needed two scores .

In June 1964 , Chaney , Schwerner , and Goodman went to Neshoba County , Mississippi , to meet with members of a black church that had been bombed and burned . The three disappeared that night on their way back to Meridian . Following a massive FBI investigation , their murdered bodies were found two months later , buried in an earthen dam .

Many temnospondyls are much larger than living amphibians , and superficially resemble crocodiles . Others are smaller and resemble salamanders . Most have broad , flat heads that are either blunt brevirostrine or elongated longirostrine . The skulls are rounded or triangular in shape when viewed from above , and are usually covered in pits and ridges . The rugged surfaces of bones may have supported blood vessels , which could transfer carbon dioxide to the bones to neutralize acidic build up in the blood early semiaquatic tetrapods would have had difficulty expelling carbon dioxide from their bodies while on land , and these dermal bones may have been an early solution to the problem . Many temnospondyls also have canal - like grooves in their skulls called sensory sulci . The sulci , which usually run around the nostrils and eye sockets , are part of a lateral line system used to detect vibrations in water . As semiaquatic animals , most temnospondyls have small limbs with four toes on each front foot and five on each hind foot . Terrestrial temnospondyls have larger , thicker limbs , and some even have claws . One unusual terrestrial temnospondyl , Fayella , has relatively long limbs for its body , and probably lived as an active runner able to chase prey .

In October 1996 , the group rented a mansion in Rancho Santa Fe , California . That year , they recorded two video messages in which they offered their viewers a last chance to evacuate Earth . Around the same time , they learned of the approach of Comet Hale Bopp . Applewhite now believed that Nettles was aboard a spaceship trailing the comet , and that she planned to rendezvous with them . He told his followers that the vessel would transport them to an empyrean destination , and that there was a government conspiracy to suppress word of the craft . In addition , he stated that his deceased followers would be taken by the vessel as well , a belief that resembled the Christian pretribulation rapture doctrine . It is not known how he learned of the comet or why he believed that it was accompanied by extraterrestrials or why he should have believed the dead Nettles would be with them .

It now provides the supply and delivery of potable water and sewerage system in Manila , but it does not provide service to the southeastern part of the city which belongs to the east zone that is served by Manila Water . Electric services are provided by Meralco , the sole electric power distributor in Metro Manila .

The most damaging Lock Haven flood was caused by the remnants of Hurricane Agnes in 1972 . The storm , just below hurricane strength when it reached the region , made landfall on June 22 near New York City . Agnes merged with a non - tropical low on June 23 , and the combined system affected the northeastern United States until June 25 . The combination produced widespread rains of 6 to 12 inches 152 to 305 mm with local amounts up to 19 inches 483 mm in western Schuylkill County , about 75 miles 121 km southeast of Lock Haven . At Lock Haven , the river crested on June 23 at 31 . 3 feet 9 . 5 m , second only to the 1936 crest . The flood greatly damaged the paper mill and Piper Aircraft .
When the weather improved , work commenced outside . The cap circle was mostly constructed before the first work - in commenced . The work - ins took place over two separate weeks in July and August , with 35 people participating . During the first work - in , the fantail posts and braces were fitted . The oak cap ribs , which had been prefabricated offsite were fitted and the finial was supported by scaffolding ready for final fitting . Intermdiate noggings of oak were fitted and the finial was pulled into position using a windlass . The cap frame was competed with the fitting of intermediate ribs and noggings . The rear of the cap circle was also completed during this time .
The most basic frames are called primary frameworks . A primary framework takes an individual 's experience or an aspect of a scene that would originally be meaningless and makes it meaningful . One type of primary framework is a natural framework , which identifies situations in the natural world and is completely biophysical , with no human influences . The other type of framework is a social framework , which explains events and connects them to humans . An example of a natural framework is the weather , and an example of a social framework is a meteorologist who predicts the weather . Focusing on the social frameworks , Goffman seeks to construct a general statement regarding the structure , or form , of experiences individuals have at any moment of their social life .
During the post - Civil - War period , leaders such as George T. Ruby and Norris Wright Cuney , who headed the Texas Republican Party and promoted civil rights for freedmen , helped to dramatically improve educational and employment opportunities for blacks in Galveston and in Texas .

Galveston was a cosmopolitan city and one of the more successful during Reconstruction ; the Freedmen 's Bureau was headquartered here . German families sheltered teachers from the North , and hundreds of freedmen were taught to read . Its business community promoted progress , and immigrants continued to stay after arriving at this port of entry .
